GREATER CHONGQING, THE UNITED FEDERATION OF CHINA

====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[1]:0,92
[At its prewar height, this region boasted a population of over thirty-five million people.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[1]:92,130
Now, there are barely fifty thousand.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[1]:130,281
Reconstruction funds have been slow to arrive in this part of the country, the government choosing to concentrate on the more densely populated coast.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[1]:281,357
There is no central power grid, no running water besides the Yangtze River.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[1]:357,467
But the streets are clear of rubble and the local “security council” has prevented any postwar outbreaks.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[1]:467,638
The chairman of that council is Kwang Jingshu, a medical doctor who, despite his advanced age and wartime injuries, still manages to make house calls to all his patients.]
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[2]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[3]:0,78
The first outbreak I saw was in a remote village that officially had no name.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[3]:78,176
The residents called it “New Dachang,” but this was more out of nostalgia than anything else.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[3]:176,327
Their former home, “Old Dachang,” had stood since the period of the Three Kingdoms, with farms and houses and even trees said to be centuries old.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[3]:327,490
When the Three Gorges Dam was completed, and reservoir waters began to rise, much of Dachang had been disassembled, brick by brick, then rebuilt on higher ground.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[3]:490,719
This New Dachang, however, was not a town anymore, but a “national historic museum.” It must have been a heartbreaking irony for those poor peasants, to see their town saved but then only being able to visit it as a tourist.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[3]:719,889
Maybe that is why some of them chose to name their newly constructed hamlet “New Dachang” to preserve some connection to their heritage, even if it was only in name.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[3]:889,1013
I personally didn’t know that this other New Dachang existed, so you can imagine how confused I was when the call came in.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[4]:0,109
The hospital was quiet; it had been a slow night, even for the increasing number of drunk-driving accidents.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[4]:109,149
Motorcycles were becoming very popular.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[4]:149,253
We used to say that your Harley-Davidsons killed more young Chinese than all the GIs in the Korean War.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[4]:253,303
That’s why I was so grateful for a quiet shift.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[4]:303,340
I was tired, my back and feet ached.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[4]:340,434
I was on my way out to smoke a cigarette and watch the dawn when I heard my name being paged.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[4]:434,515
The receptionist that night was new and couldn’t quite understand the dialect.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[4]:515,558
There had been an accident, or an illness.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[4]:558,640
It was an emergency, that part was obvious, and could we please send help at once.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[5]:0,18
What could I say?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[5]:18,200
The younger doctors, the kids who think medicine is just a way to pad their bank accounts, they certainly weren’t going to go help some “nongmin” just for the sake of helping.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[5]:200,251
I guess I’m still an old revolutionary at heart.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[5]:251,502
“Our duty is to hold ourselves responsible to the people.” 1 Those words still mean something to me…and I tried to remember that as my Deer 2 bounced and banged over dirt roads the government had promised but never quite gotten around to paving.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[6]:0,43
I had a devil of a time finding the place.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[6]:43,108
Officially, it didn’t exist and therefore wasn’t on any map.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[6]:108,217
I became lost several times and had to ask directions from locals who kept thinking I meant the museum town.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[6]:217,305
I was in an impatient mood by the time I reached the small collection of hilltop homes.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[6]:305,361
I remember thinking, This had better be damned serious.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[6]:361,405
Once I saw their faces, I regretted my wish.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[7]:0,61
There were seven of them, all on cots, all barely conscious.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[7]:61,128
The villagers had moved them into their new communal meeting hall.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[7]:128,166
The walls and floor were bare cement.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[7]:166,193
The air was cold and damp.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[7]:193,230
Of course they’re sick, I thought.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[7]:230,294
I asked the villagers who had been taking care of these people.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[7]:294,394
They said no one, it wasn’t “safe.” I noticed that the door had been locked from the outside.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[7]:394,432
The villagers were clearly terrified.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[7]:432,497
They cringed and whispered; some kept their distance and prayed.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[7]:497,621
Their behavior made me angry, not at them, you understand, not as individuals, but what they represented about our country.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[7]:621,769
After centuries of foreign oppression, exploitation, and humiliation, we were finally reclaiming our rightful place as humanity’s middle kingdom.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[7]:769,883
We were the world’s richest and most dynamic superpower, masters of everything from outer space to cyber space.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[7]:883,1099
It was the dawn of what the world was finally acknowledging as “The Chinese Century” and yet so many of us still lived like these ignorant peasants, as stagnant and superstitious as the earliest Yangshao savages.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[8]:0,92
I was still lost in my grand, cultural criticism when I knelt to examine the first patient.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[8]:92,181
She was running a high fever, forty degrees centigrade, and she was shivering violently.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[8]:181,253
Barely coherent, she whimpered slightly when I tried to move her limbs.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[8]:253,306
There was a wound in her right forearm, a bite mark.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[8]:306,381
As I examined it more closely, I realized that it wasn’t from an animal.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[8]:381,476
The bite radius and teeth marks had to have come from a small, or possibly young, human being.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[8]:476,582
Although I hypothesized this to be the source of the infection, the actual injury was surprisingly clean.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[8]:582,654
I asked the villagers, again, who had been taking care of these people.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[8]:654,682
Again, they told me no one.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[8]:682,713
I knew this could not be true.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[8]:713,797
The human mouth is packed with bacteria, even more so than the most unhygienic dog.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[8]:797,882
If no one had cleaned this woman’s wound, why wasn’t it throbbing with infection?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[9]:0,35
I examined the six other patients.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[9]:35,121
All showed similar symptoms, all had similar wounds on various parts of their bodies.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[9]:121,209
I asked one man, the most lucid of the group, who or what had inflicted these injuries.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[9]:209,276
He told me it had happened when they had tried to subdue “him.”
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[10]
“Who?” I asked.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[11]:0,85
I found “Patient Zero” behind the locked door of an abandoned house across town.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[11]:85,110
He was twelve years old.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[11]:110,169
His wrists and feet were bound with plastic packing twine.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[11]:169,243
Although he’d rubbed off the skin around his bonds, there was no blood.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[11]:243,387
There was also no blood on his other wounds, not on the gouges on his legs or arms, or from the large dry gap where his right big toe had been.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[11]:387,444
He was writhing like an animal; a gag muffled his growls.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[12]:0,46
At first the villagers tried to hold me back.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[12]:46,161
They warned me not to touch him, that he was “cursed.” I shrugged them off and reached for my mask and gloves.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[12]:161,230
The boy’s skin was as cold and gray as the cement on which he lay.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[12]:230,280
I could find neither his heartbeat nor his pulse.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[12]:280,339
His eyes were wild, wide and sunken back in their sockets.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[12]:339,390
They remained locked on me like a predatory beast.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[12]:390,518
Throughout the examination he was inexplicably hostile, reaching for me with his bound hands and snapping at me through his gag.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[13]:0,103
His movements were so violent I had to call for two of the largest villagers to help me hold him down.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[13]:103,179
Initially they wouldn’t budge, cowering in the doorway like baby rabbits.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[13]:179,258
I explained that there was no risk of infection if they used gloves and masks.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[13]:258,354
When they shook their heads, I made it an order, even though I had no lawful authority to do so.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[14]:0,22
That was all it took.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[14]:22,52
The two oxen knelt beside me.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[14]:52,113
One held the boy’s feet while the other grasped his hands.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[14]:113,194
I tried to take a blood sample and instead extracted only brown, viscous matter.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[14]:194,276
As I was withdrawing the needle, the boy began another bout of violent struggling.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[15]:0,173
One of my “orderlies,” the one responsible for his arms, gave up trying to hold them and thought it might safer if he just braced them against the floor with his knees.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[15]:173,229
But the boy jerked again and I heard his left arm snap.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[15]:229,303
Jagged ends of both radius and ulna bones stabbed through his gray flesh.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[15]:303,437
Although the boy didn’t cry out, didn’t even seem to notice, it was enough for both assistants to leap back and run from the room.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[16]:0,48
I instinctively retreated several paces myself.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[16]:48,128
I am embarrassed to admit this; I have been a doctor for most of my adult life.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[16]:128,215
I was trained and…you could even say “raised” by the People’s Liberation Army.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[16]:215,371
I’ve treated more than my share of combat injuries, faced my own death on more than one occasion, and now I was scared, truly scared, of this frail child.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[17]:0,72
The boy began to twist in my direction, his arm ripped completely free.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[17]:72,153
Flesh and muscle tore from one another until there was nothing except the stump.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[17]:153,248
His now free right arm, still tied to the severed left hand, dragged his body across the floor.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[18]:0,47
I hurried outside, locking the door behind me.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[18]:47,101
I tried to compose myself, control my fear and shame.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[18]:101,180
My voice still cracked as I asked the villagers how the boy had been infected.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[18]:180,197
No one answered.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[18]:197,290
I began to hear banging on the door, the boy’s fist pounding weakly against the thin wood.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[18]:290,338
It was all I could do not to jump at the sound.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[18]:338,402
I prayed they would not notice the color draining from my face.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[18]:402,494
I shouted, as much from fear as frustration, that I had to know what happened to this child.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[19]:0,46
A young woman came forward, maybe his mother.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[19]:46,130
You could tell that she had been crying for days; her eyes were dry and deeply red.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[19]:130,313
She admitted that it had happened when the boy and his father were “moon fishing,” a term that describes diving for treasure among the sunken ruins of the Three Gorges Reservoir.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[19]:313,447
With more than eleven hundred abandoned villages, towns, and even cities, there was always the hope of recovering something valuable.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[19]:447,515
It was a very common practice in those days, and also very illegal.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[19]:515,706
She explained that they weren’t looting, that it was their own village, Old Dachang, and they were just trying to recover some heirlooms from the remaining houses that hadn’t been moved.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[19]:706,797
She repeated the point, and I had to interrupt her with promises not to inform the police.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[19]:797,877
She finally explained that the boy came up crying with a bite mark on his foot.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[19]:877,952
He didn’t know what had happened, the water had been too dark and muddy.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[19]:952,984
His father was never seen again.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[20]:0,186
I reached for my cell phone and dialed the number of Doctor Gu Wen Kuei, an old comrade from my army days who now worked at the Institute of Infectious Diseases at Chongqing University.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[20]:186,277
3 We exchanged pleasantries, discussing our health, our grandchildren; it was only proper.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[20]:277,387
I then told him about the outbreak and listened as he made some joke about the hygiene habits of hillbillies.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[20]:387,476
I tried to chuckle along but continued that I thought the incident might be significant.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[20]:476,531
Almost reluctantly he asked me what the symptoms were.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[20]:531,624
I told him everything: the bites, the fever, the boy, the arm…his face suddenly stiffened.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[20]:624,639
His smile died.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[21]:0,38
He asked me to show him the infected.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[21]:38,130
I went back into the meeting hall and waved the phone’s camera over each of the patients.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[21]:130,202
He asked me to move the camera closer to some of the wounds themselves.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[21]:202,298
I did so and when I brought the screen back to my face, I saw that his video image had been cut.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[22]:0,70
“Stay where you are,” he said, just a distant, removed voice now.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[22]:70,135
“Take the names of all who have had contact with the infected.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[22]:135,168
Restrain those already infected.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[22]:168,333
If any have passed into coma, vacate the room and secure the exit.” His voice was flat, robotic, as if he had rehearsed this speech or was reading from something.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[22]:333,398
He asked me, “Are you armed?” “Why would I be?” I asked.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[22]:398,454
He told me he would get back to me, all business again.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[22]:454,549
He said he had to make a few calls and that I should expect “support” within several hours.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[23]:0,120
They were there in less than one, fifty men in large army Z-8A helicopters; all were wearing hazardous materials suits.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[23]:120,169
They said they were from the Ministry of Health.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[23]:169,220
I don’t know who they thought they were kidding.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[23]:220,338
With their bullying swagger, their intimidating arrogance, even these backwater bumpkins could recognize the Guoanbu.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[23]:338,339
4
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[24]:0,43
Their first priority was the meeting hall.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[24]:43,131
The patients were carried out on stretchers, their limbs shackled, their mouths gagged.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[24]:131,160
Next, they went for the boy.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[24]:160,187
He came out in a body bag.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[24]:187,328
His mother was wailing as she and the rest of the village were rounded up for “examinations.” Their names were taken, their blood drawn.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[24]:328,376
One by one they were stripped and photographed.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[24]:376,429
The last one to be exposed was a withered old woman.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[24]:429,551
She had a thin, crooked body, a face with a thousand lines and tiny feet that had to have been bound when she was a girl.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[24]:551,647
She was shaking her bony fist at the “doctors.” “This is your punishment!” she shouted.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[24]:647,680
“This is revenge for Fengdu!”
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[25]:0,101
She was referring to the City of Ghosts, whose temples and shrines were dedicated to the underworld.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[25]:101,189
Like Old Dachang, it had been an unlucky obstacle to China’s next Great Leap Forward.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[25]:189,259
It had been evacuated, then demolished, then almost entirely drowned.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[25]:259,374
I’ve never been a superstitious person and I’ve never allowed myself to be hooked on the opiate of the people.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[25]:374,403
I’m a doctor, a scientist.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[25]:403,447
I believe only in what I can see and touch.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[25]:447,519
I’ve never seen Fengdu as anything but a cheap, kitschy tourist trap.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[25]:519,843
Of course this ancient crone’s words had no effect on me, but her tone, her anger…she had witnessed enough calamity in her years upon the earth: the warlords, the Japanese, the insane nightmare of the Cultural Revolution…she knew that another storm was coming, even if she didn’t have the education to understand it.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[26]:0,51
My colleague Dr. Kuei had understood all too well.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[26]:51,196
He’d even risked his neck to warn me, to give me enough time to call and maybe alert a few others before the “Ministry of Health” arrived.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[26]:196,340
It was something he had said…a phrase he hadn’t used in a very long time, not since those “minor” border clashes with the Soviet Union.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[26]:340,363
That was back in 1969.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[26]:363,470
We had been in an earthen bunker on our side of the Ussuri, less than a kilometer downriver from Chen Bao.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[26]:470,565
The Russians were preparing to retake the island, their massive artillery hammering our forces.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[27]:0,101
Gu and I had been trying to remove shrapnel from the belly of this soldier not much younger than us.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[27]:101,199
The boy’s lower intestines had been torn open, his blood and excrement were all over our gowns.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[27]:199,410
Every seven seconds a round would land close by and we would have to bend over his body to shield the wound from falling earth, and every time we would be close enough to hear him whimper softly for his mother.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[27]:410,591
There were other voices, too, rising from the pitch darkness just beyond the entrance to our bunker, desperate, angry voices that weren’t supposed to be on our side of the river.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[27]:591,652
We had two infantrymen stationed at the bunker’s entrance.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[27]:652,722
One of them shouted “Spetsnaz!” and started firing into the dark.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[27]:722,796
We could hear other shots now as well, ours or theirs, we couldn’t tell.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[28]:0,50
Another round hit and we bent over the dying boy.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[28]:50,100
Gu’s face was only a few centimeters from mine.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[28]:100,143
There was sweat pouring down his forehead.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[28]:143,232
Even in the dim light of one paraffin lantern, I could see that he was shaking and pale.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[28]:232,440
He looked at the patient, then at the doorway, then at me, and suddenly he said, “Don’t worry, everything’s going to be all right.” Now, this is a man who has never said a positive thing in his life.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[28]:440,481
Gu was a worrier, a neurotic curmudgeon.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[28]:481,583
If he had a headache, it was a brain tumor; if it looked like rain, this year’s harvest was ruined.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[28]:583,681
This was his way of controlling the situation, his lifelong strategy for always coming out ahead.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[28]:681,828
Now, when reality looked more dire than any of his fatalistic predictions, he had no choice but to turn tail and charge in the opposite direction.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[28]:828,945
“Don’t worry, everything’s going to be all right.” For the first time everything turned out as he predicted.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[28]:945,1022
The Russians never crossed the river and we even managed to save our patient.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[29]:0,190
For years afterward I would tease him about what it took to pry out a little ray of sunshine, and he would always respond that it would take a hell of a lot worse to get him to do it again.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[29]:190,252
Now we were old men, and something worse was about to happen.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[29]:252,299
It was right after he asked me if I was armed.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[29]:299,405
“No,” I said, “why should I be?” There was a brief silence, I’m sure other ears were listening.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[29]:405,544
“Don’t worry,” he said, “everything’s going to be all right.” That was when I realized that this was not an isolated outbreak.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[29]:544,616
I ended the call and quickly placed another to my daughter in Guangzhou.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[30]:0,88
Her husband worked for China Telecom and spent at least one week of every month abroad.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[30]:88,240
I told her it would be a good idea to accompany him the next time he left and that she should take my granddaughter and stay for as long as they could.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[30]:240,333
I didn’t have time to explain; my signal was jammed just as the first helicopter appeared.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[30]:333,434
The last thing I managed to say to her was “Don’t worry, everything’s going to be all right.”

Before the outbreak started, overland smuggling was never popular.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[37]:67,189
To arrange for the passports, the fake tour buses, the contacts and protection on the other side all took a lot of money.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[37]:189,261
Back then, the only two lucrative routes were into Thailand or Myanmar.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[37]:261,343
Where I used to live, in Kashi, the only option was into the ex-Soviet republics.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[37]:343,417
No one wanted to go there, and that is why I wasn’t initially a shetou.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[37]:417,544
1 I was an importer: raw opium, uncut diamonds, girls, boys, whatever was valuable from those primitive excuses for countries.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[37]:544,575
The outbreak changed all that.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[37]:575,706
Suddenly we were besieged with offers, and not just from the liudong renkou, 2 but also, as you say, from people on the up-and-up.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[37]:706,787
I had urban professionals, private farmers, even low-level government officials.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[37]:787,828
These were people who had a lot to lose.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[37]:828,898
They didn’t care where they were going, they just needed to get out.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[38]
Did you know what they were fleeing?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[39]:0,25
We’d heard the rumors.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[39]:25,73
We’d even had an outbreak somewhere in Kashi.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[39]:73,121
The government had hushed it up pretty quickly.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[39]:121,165
But we guessed, we knew something was wrong.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[40]
Didn’t the government try to shut you down?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[41]:0,21
Officially they did.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[41]:21,97
Penalties on smuggling were hardened; border checkpoints were strengthened.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[41]:97,165
They even executed a few shetou, publicly, just to make an example.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[41]:165,283
If you didn’t know the true story, if you didn’t know it from my end, you’d think it was an efficient crackdown.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[42]
You’re saying it wasn’t?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[43]:0,94
I’m saying I made a lot of people rich: border guards, bureaucrats, police, even the mayor.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[43]:94,247
These were still good times for China, where the best way to honor Chairman Mao’s memory was to see his face on as many hundred yuan notes as possible.

Kashi was a boomtown.

/html/body/div/div[1]/p[45]:22,146
I think 90 percent, maybe more, of all westbound, overland traffic came through with even a little left over for air travel.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[46]
Air travel?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[47]:0,15
Just a little.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[47]:15,119
I only dabbled in transporting renshe by air, a few cargo flights now and then to Kazakhstan or Russia.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[47]:119,136
Small-time jobs.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[47]:136,238
It wasn’t like the east, where Guangdong or Jiangsu were getting thousands of people out every week.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[48]
Could you elaborate?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[49]:0,60
Air smuggling became big business in the eastern provinces.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[49]:60,168
These were rich clients, the ones who could afford prebooked travel packages and first-class tourist visas.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[49]:168,332
They would step off the plane at London or Rome, or even San Francisco, check into their hotels, go out for a day’s sightseeing, and simply vanish into thin air.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[49]:332,352
That was big money.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[49]:352,400
I’d always wanted to break into air transport.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[50]:0,26
But what about infection?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[50]:26,68
Wasn’t there a risk of being discovered?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:0,39
That was only later, after Flight 575.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:39,105
Initially there weren’t too many infected taking these flights.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:105,154
If they did, they were in the very early stages.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:154,194
Air transport shetou were very careful.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:194,270
If you showed any signs of advanced infection, they wouldn’t go near you.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:270,311
They were out to protect their business.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:311,418
The golden rule was, you couldn’t fool foreign immigration officials until you fooled your shetou first.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:418,512
You had to look and act completely healthy, and even then, it was always a race against time.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:512,614
Before Flight 575, I heard this one story about a couple, a very well-to-do businessman and his wife.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:614,634
He had been bitten.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:634,748
Not a serious one, you understand, but one of the “slow burns,” where all the major blood vessels are missed.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:748,829
I’m sure they thought there was a cure in the West, a lot of the infected did.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:829,910
Apparently, they reached their hotel room in Paris just as he began to collapse.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:910,964
His wife tried to call the doctor, but he forbade it.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:964,1003
He was afraid they would be sent back.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:1003,1084
Instead, he ordered her to abandon him, to leave now before he lapsed into coma.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:1084,1230
I hear that she did, and after two days of groans and commotion, the hotel staff finally ignored the DO NOT DISTURB sign and broke into the room.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[51]:1230,1315
I’m not sure if that is how the Paris outbreak started, though it would make sense.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[52]
You say they didn’t call for a doctor, that they were afraid they’d be sent back, but then why try to find a cure in the West?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[53]:0,59
You really don’t understand a refugee’s heart, do you?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[53]:59,88
These people were desperate.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[53]:88,195
They were trapped between their infections and being rounded up and “treated” by their own government.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[53]:195,385
If you had a loved one, a family member, a child, who was infected, and you thought there was a shred of hope in some other country, wouldn’t you do everything in your power to get there?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[53]:385,431
Wouldn’t you want to believe there was hope?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[54]
You said that man’s wife, along with the other renshe, vanished into thin air.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[55]:0,56
It has always been this way, even before the outbreaks.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[55]:56,98
Some stay with family, some with friends.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[55]:98,178
Many of the poorer ones had to work off their bao 3 to the local Chinese mafia.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[55]:178,250
The majority of them simply melted into the host country’s underbelly.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[56]
The low-income areas?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[57]:0,40
If that’s what you want to call them.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[57]:40,142
What better place to hide than among that part of society that no one else even wants to acknowledge.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[57]:142,219
How else could so many outbreaks have started in so many First World ghettos?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[58]
It’s been said that many shetou propagated the myth of a miracle cure in other countries.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[59]
Some.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[60]
Did you?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[61]
[Pause.]
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[62]

No.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[64]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[65]
[Another pause.]
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[66]
How did Flight 575 change air smuggling?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[67]:0,60
Restrictions were tightened, but only in certain countries.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[67]:60,120
Airline shetou were careful but they were also resourceful.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[67]:120,209
They used to have this saying, “every rich man’s house has a servant’s entrance.”
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[68]
What does that mean?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[69]:0,73
If western Europe has increased its security, go through eastern Europe.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[69]:73,85
If the U.S.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[69]:85,124
won’t let you in, go through Mexico.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[69]:124,260
I’m sure it helped make the rich white countries feel safer, even though they had infestations already bubbling within their borders.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[69]:260,385
This is not my area of expertise, you remember, I was primarily land transport, and my target countries were in central Asia.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[70]
Were they easier to enter?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[71]:0,45
They practically begged us for the business.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[71]:45,223
Those countries were in such economic shambles, their officials were so backward and corrupt, they actually helped us with the paperwork in exchange for a percentage of our fee.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[71]:223,493
There were even shetou, or whatever they called them in their barbarian babble, who worked with us to get renshe across the old Soviet republics into countries like India or Russia, even Iran, although I never asked or wanted to know where any of the renshe were going.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[71]:493,521
My job ended at the border.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[71]:521,611
Just get their papers stamped, their vehicles tagged, pay the guards off, and take my cut.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[72]
Did you see many infected?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[73]:0,22
Not in the beginning.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[73]:22,50
The blight worked too fast.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[73]:50,79
It wasn’t like air travel.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[73]:79,204
It might take weeks to reach Kashi, and even the slowest of burns, I’ve been told, couldn’t last longer than a few days.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[73]:204,329
Infected clients usually reanimated somewhere on the road, where they would be recognized and collected by the local police.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[73]:329,447
Later, as the infestations multiplied and the police became overwhelmed, I began to see a lot of infected on my route.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[74]
Were they dangerous?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[75]:0,8
Rarely.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[75]:8,56
Their family usually had them bound and gagged.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[75]:56,158
You’d see something moving in the back of a car, squirming softly under clothing or heavy blankets.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[75]:158,259
You’d hear banging from a car’s boot, or, later, from crates with airholes in the backs of vans.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[75]:259,335
Airholes…they really didn’t know what was happening to their loved ones.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[76]
Did you?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[77]:0,81
By then, yes, but I knew trying to explain it to them would be a hopeless cause.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[77]:81,133
I just took their money and sent them on their way.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[77]:133,146
I was lucky.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[77]:146,201
I never had to deal with the problems of sea smuggling.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[78]
That was more difficult?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[79]:0,15
And dangerous.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[79]:15,178
My associates from the coastal provinces were the ones who had to contend with the possibility of an infected breaking its bonds and contaminating the entire hold.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[80]
What did they do?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[81]:0,239
I’ve heard of various “solutions.” Sometimes ships would pull up to a stretch of deserted coast—it didn’t matter if it was the intended country, it could have been any coast—and “unload” the infected renshe onto the beach.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[81]:239,360
I’ve heard of some captains making for an empty stretch of open sea and just tossing the whole writhing lot overboard.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[81]:360,554
That might explain the early cases of swimmers and divers starting to disappear without a trace, or why you’d hear of people all around the world saying they saw them walking out of the surf.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[81]:554,593
At least I never had to deal with that.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[82]:0,80
I did have one similar incident, the one that convinced me it was time to quit.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[82]:80,124
There was this truck, a beat-up old jalopy.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[82]:124,167
You could hear the moans from the trailer.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[82]:167,218
A lot of fists were slamming against the aluminum.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[82]:218,258
It was actually swaying back and forth.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[82]:258,326
In the cab there was a very wealthy investment banker from Xi’an.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[82]:326,390
He’d made a lot of money buying up American credit card debt.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[82]:390,443
He had enough to pay for his entire extended family.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[82]:443,489
The man’s Armani suit was rumpled and torn.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[82]:489,617
There were scratch marks down the side of his face, and his eyes had that frantic fire I was starting to see more of every day.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[82]:617,753
The driver’s eyes had a different look, the same one as me, the look that maybe money wasn’t going to be much good for much longer.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[82]:753,807
I slipped the man an extra fifty and wished him luck.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[82]:807,831
That was all I could do.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[83]
Where was the truck headed?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[84]

Our mission was strictly conventional, opium and hash, the primary export crop of terrorists around the world.

That’s all we’d ever encountered in that rocky wasteland.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[88]:501,545
Traders and thugs and locally hired muscle.

/html/body/div/div[1]/p[89]:252,369
There was plenty of blood, blood and bits of brown rotting flesh, but the only corpses we found were the pack mules.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[89]:369,441
They’d been brought down, not shot, by what looked like wild animals.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[89]:441,512
Their bellies were torn out and large bite wounds covered their flesh.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[89]:512,547
We guessed it had to be wild dogs.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[89]:547,625
Packs of those damn things roamed the valleys, big and nasty as Arctic wolves.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[90]:0,101
What was most puzzling was the cargo, still in their saddlebags, or just scattered about the bodies.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[90]:101,377
Now, even if this wasn’t a territorial hit, even if it was a religious or tribal revenge killing, no one just abandons fifty kilos of prime, raw, Bad Brown, 1 or perfectly good assault rifles, or expensive personal trophies like watches, mini disc players, and GPS locaters.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[91]:0,72
The blood trail led up the mountain path from the massacre in the wadi.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[91]:72,88
A lot of blood.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[91]:88,146
Anyone who lost that much wouldn’t be getting up again.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[91]:146,167
Only somehow he did.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[91]:167,193
He hadn’t been treated.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[91]:193,226
There were no other track marks.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[91]:226,356
From what we could tell, this man had run, bled, fallen facedown—we still could see his bloody face-mark imprinted in the sand.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[91]:356,493
Somehow, without suffocating, without bleeding to death, he’d lain there for some time, then just gotten up again and started walking.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[91]:493,544
These new tracks were very different from the old.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[91]:544,579
They were slower, closer together.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[91]:579,674
His right foot was dragging, clearly why he’d lost his shoe, an old, worn-out Nike high-top.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[91]:674,716
The drag marks were sprinkled with fluid.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[91]:716,808
Not blood, not human, but droplets of hard, black, crusted ooze that none of us recognized.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[91]:808,873
We followed these and the drag marks to the entrance of the cave.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[92]:0,53
There was no opening fire, no reception of any kind.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[92]:53,107
We found the tunnel entrance unguarded and wide open.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[92]:107,180
Immediately we began to see bodies, men killed by their own booby traps.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[92]:180,241
They looked like they’d been trying…running…to get out.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[93]:0,201
Beyond them, in the first chamber, we saw our first evidence of a one-sided firefight, one-sided because only one wall of the cavern was pockmarked by small arms. Opposite that wall were the shooters.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[93]:201,227
They’d been torn apart.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[93]:227,377
Their limbs, their bones, shredded and gnawed…some still clutching their weapons, one of those severed hands with an old Makarov still in the grip.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[93]:377,408
The hand was missing a finger.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[93]:408,518
I found it across the room, along with the body of another unarmed man who’d been hit over a hundred times.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[93]:518,568
Several rounds had taken the top of his head off.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[93]:568,613
The finger was still stuck between his teeth.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[94]:0,36
Every chamber told a similar story.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[94]:36,84
We found smashed barricades, discarded weapons.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[94]:84,125
We found more bodies, or pieces of them.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[94]:125,168
Only the intact ones died from head shots.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[94]:168,245
We found meat, chewed, pulped flesh bulging from their throats and stomachs.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[94]:245,386
You could see by the blood trails, the footprints, the shell casings, and pockmarks that the entire battle had originated from the infirmary.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[95]:0,40
We discovered several cots, all bloody.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[95]:40,226
At the end of the room we found a headless…I’m guessing, doctor, lying on the dirt floor next to a cot with soiled sheets and clothes and an old, left-footed, worn-out Nike high-top.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[96]:0,92
The last tunnel we checked had collapsed from the use of a booby-trapped demolition charge.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[96]:92,134
A hand was sticking out of the limestone.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[96]:134,155
It was still moving.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[96]:155,229
I reacted from the gut, leaned forward, grabbed the hand, felt that grip.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[96]:229,268
Like steel, almost crushed my fingers.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[96]:268,302
I pulled back, tried to get away.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[96]:302,327
It wouldn’t let me go.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[96]:327,360
I pulled harder, dug my feet in.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[96]:360,517
First the arm came free, then the head, the torn face, wide eyes and gray lips, then the other hand, grabbing my arm and squeezing, then came the shoulders.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[96]:517,569
I fell back, the thing’s top half coming with me.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[96]:569,676
The waist down was still jammed under the rocks, still connected to the upper torso by a line of entrails.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[96]:676,753
It was still moving, still clawing me, trying to pull my arm into its mouth.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[96]:753,777
I reached for my weapon.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[97]:0,124
The burst was angled upward, connecting just under and behind the chin and spraying its brains across the ceiling above us.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[97]:124,180
I’d been the only one in the tunnel when it happened.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[97]:180,205
I was the only witness…
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[98]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[99]
[He pauses.]
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[100]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[101]:0,152
“Exposure to unknown chemical agents.” That’s what they told me back in Edmonton, that or an adverse reaction to our own prophylactic medication.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[101]:152,209
They threw in a healthy dose of PTSD 2 for good measure.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[101]:209,267
I just needed rest, rest and long-term “evaluation”…
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[102]:0,68
“Evaluation”…that’s what happens when it’s your own side.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[102]:68,123
It’s only “interrogation” when it’s the enemy.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[102]:123,200
They teach you how to resist the enemy, how to protect your mind and spirit.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[102]:200,378
They don’t teach you how to resist your own people, especially people who think they’re trying to “help” you see “the truth.” They didn’t break me, I broke myself.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[102]:378,433
I wanted to believe them and I wanted them to help me.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[102]:433,561
I was a good soldier, well trained, experienced; I knew what I could do to my fellow human beings and what they could do to me.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[102]:561,597
I thought I was ready for anything.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[102]:597,700
[He looks out at the valley, his eyes unfocused.] Who in his right mind could have been ready for this?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[103]
THE AMAZON RAIN FOREST, BRAZIL
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[104]:0,71
[I arrive blindfolded, so as not to reveal my “hosts’” location.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[104]:71,371
Outsiders call them the Yanomami, “The Fierce People,” and it is unknown whether this supposedly warlike nature or the fact that their new village hangs suspended from the tallest trees was what allowed them to weather the crisis as well, if not better, than even the most industrialized nation.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[104]:371,524
It is not clear whether Fernando Oliveira, the emaciated, drug-addicted white man “from the edge of the world,” is their guest, mascot, or prisoner.]
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[105]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[106]:0,51
I was still a doctor, that’s what I told myself.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[106]:51,176
Yes, I was rich, and getting richer all the time, but at least my success came from performing necessary medical procedures.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[106]:176,287
I wasn’t just slicing and dicing little teenage noses or sewing Sudanese “pintos” onto sheboy pop divas.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[106]:287,448
1 I was still a doctor, I was still helping people, and if it was so “immoral” to the self-righteous, hypocritical North, why did their citizens keep coming?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[107]:0,107
The package arrived from the airport an hour before the patient, packed in ice in a plastic picnic cooler.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[107]:107,134
Hearts are extremely rare.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[107]:134,318
Not like livers or skin tissue, and certainly not like kidneys, which, after the “presumed consent” law was passed, you could get from almost any hospital or morgue in the country.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[108]
Was it tested?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[109]:0,10
For what?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[109]:10,86
In order to test for something, you have to know what you’re looking for.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[109]:86,130
We didn’t know about Walking Plague then.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[109]:130,250
We were concerned with conventional ailments—hepatitis or HIV/AIDS—and we didn’t even have time to test for those.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[110]
Why is that?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[111]:0,46
Because the flight had already taken so long.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[111]:46,85
Organs can’t be kept on ice forever.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[111]:85,132
We were already pushing our luck with this one.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[112]
Where had it come from?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[113]:0,20
China, most likely.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[113]:20,53
My broker operated out of Macau.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[113]:53,69
We trusted him.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[113]:69,91
His record was solid.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[113]:91,178
When he assured us that the package was “clean,” I took him at his word; I had to.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[113]:178,236
He knew the risks involved, so did I, so did the patient.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[113]:236,385
Herr Muller, in addition to his conventional heart ailments, was cursed with the extremely rare genetic defect of dextrocardia with situs in-versus.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[113]:385,511
His organs lay in their exact opposite position; the liver was on the left side, the heart entryways on the right, and so on.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[113]:511,556
You see the unique situation we were facing.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[113]:556,638
We couldn’t have just transplanted a conventional heart and turned it backward.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[113]:638,671
It just doesn’t work that way.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[113]:671,762
We needed another fresh, healthy heart from a “donor” with exactly the same condition.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[113]:762,815
Where else but China could we find that kind of luck?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[114]
It was luck?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[115]
[Smiles.] And “political expediency.” I told my broker what I needed, gave him the specifics, and sure enough, three weeks later I received an e-mail simply titled “We have a match.”
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[116]
So you performed the operation.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[117]:0,57
I assisted, Doctor Silva performed the actual procedure.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[117]:57,174
He was a prestigious heart surgeon who worked the top cases at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in São Paulo.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[117]:174,217
Arrogant bastard, even for a cardiologist.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[117]:217,323
It killed my ego to have to work with…under…that prick, treating me like I was a first-year resident.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[117]:323,430
But what was I going to do…Herr Muller needed a new heart and my beach house needed a new herbal Jacuzzi.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[118]:0,46
Herr Muller never came out of the anesthesia.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[118]:46,138
As he lay in the recovery room, barely minutes after closing, his symptoms began to appear.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[118]:138,524
His temperature, pulse rate, oxygen saturation…I was worried, and it must have tickled my more “experienced colleague.” He told me that it was either a common reaction to the immunosuppressant medication, or the simple, expected complications of an overweight, unhealthy, sixty-seven-year-old man who’d just gone through one of the most traumatic procedures in modern medicine.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[118]:524,583
I’m surprised he didn’t pat me on the head, the prick.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[118]:583,670
He told me to go home, take a shower, get some sleep, maybe call a girl or two, relax.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[118]:670,732
He’d stay and watch him and call me if there was any change.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[119]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[120]
[Oliveira purses his lips angrily and chews another wad of the mysterious leaves at his side.]
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[121]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:0,34
And what was I supposed to think?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:34,69
Maybe it was the drugs, the OKT 3.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:69,106
Or maybe I was just being a worrier.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:106,142
This was my first heart transplant.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:142,159
What did I know?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:159,236
Still…it bothered me so much that the last thing I wanted to do was sleep.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:236,323
So I did what any good doctor should do when his patient is suffering; I hit the town.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:323,413
I danced, I drank, I had salaciously indecent things done to me by who knows who or what.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:413,487
I wasn’t even sure it was my phone vibrating the first couple of times.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:487,550
It must have been at least an hour before I finally picked up.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:550,598
Graziela, my receptionist, was in a real state.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:598,667
She told me that Herr Muller had slipped into a coma an hour before.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:667,721
I was in my car before she could finish the sentence.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:721,830
It was a thirty-minute drive back to the clinic, and I cursed both Silva and myself every second of the way.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:830,868
So I did have reason to be concerned!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:868,884
So I was right!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[122]:884,1032
Ego, you could say; even though to be right meant dire consequences for me as well, I still relished tarnishing the invincible Silva’s reputation.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[123]:0,82
I arrived to find Graziela trying to comfort a hysterical Rosi, one of my nurses.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[123]:82,114
The poor girl was inconsolable.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[123]:114,211
I gave her a good one across the cheek—that calmed her down—and asked her what was going on.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[123]:211,257
Why were there spots of blood on her uniform?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[123]:257,281
Where was Doctor Silva?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[123]:281,387
Why were some of the other patients out of their rooms, and what the hell was that goddamn banging noise?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[123]:387,460
She told me that Herr Muller had flat-lined, suddenly, and unexpectedly.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[123]:460,588
She explained that they had been trying to revive him when Herr Muller had opened his eyes and bitten Doctor Silva on the hand.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[123]:588,665
The two of them struggled; Rosi tried to help but was almost bitten herself.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[123]:665,731
She left Silva, ran from the room, and locked the door behind her.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[124]:0,18
I almost laughed.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[124]:18,40
It was so ridiculous.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[124]:40,111
Maybe Superman had slipped up, misdiagnosed him, if that was possible.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[124]:111,223
Maybe he’d just risen from the bed, and, in a stupor, had tried to grab on to Doctor Silva to steady himself.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[124]:223,359
There had to be a reasonable explanation…and yet, there was the blood on her uniform and the muffled noise from Herr Muller’s room.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[124]:359,444
I went back to the car for my gun, more so to calm Graziela and Rosi than for myself.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[125]
You carried a gun?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[126]:0,16
I lived in Rio.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[126]:16,61
What do you think I carried, my “pinto”?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[126]:61,123
I went back to Herr Muller’s room, I knocked several times.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[126]:123,140
I heard nothing.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[126]:140,177
I whispered his and Silva’s names.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[126]:177,195
No one responded.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[126]:195,244
I noticed blood seeping out from under the door.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[126]:244,287
I entered and found it covering the floor.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[126]:287,386
Silva was lying in the far corner, Muller crouching over him with his fat, pale, hairy back to me.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[126]:386,519
I can’t remember how I got his attention, whether I called his name, uttered a swear, or did anything at all but just stand there.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[126]:519,589
Muller turned to me, bits of bloody meat falling from his open mouth.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[126]:589,713
I saw that his steel sutures had been partially pried open and a thick, black, gelatinous fluid oozed through the incision.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[126]:713,768
He got shakily to his feet, lumbering slowly toward me.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[127]:0,45
I raised my pistol, aiming at his new heart.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[127]:45,130
It was a “Desert Eagle,” Israeli, large and showy, which is why I’d chosen it.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[127]:130,170
I’d never fired it before, thank God.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[127]:170,203
I wasn’t ready for the recoil.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[127]:203,256
The round went wild, literally blowing his head off.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[127]:256,376
Lucky, that’s all, this lucky fool standing there with a smoking gun, and a stream of warm urine running down my leg.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[127]:376,491
Now it was my turn to get slapped, several times by Graziela, before I came to my senses and telephoned the police.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[128]
Were you arrested?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[129]:0,15
Are you crazy?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[129]:15,95
These were my partners, how do you think I was able to get my homegrown organs.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[129]:95,150
How do you think I was able to take care of this mess?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[129]:150,179
They’re very good at that.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[129]:179,317
They helped explain to my other patients that a homicidal maniac had broken into the clinic and killed both Herr Muller and Doctor Silva.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[129]:317,399
They also made sure that none of the staff said anything to contradict that story.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[130]
What about the bodies?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[131]:0,218
They listed Silva as the victim of a probable “car jacking.” I don’t know where they put his body; maybe some ghetto side street in the City of God, a drug score gone bad just to give the story more credibility.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[131]:218,268
I hope they just burned him, or buried him…deep.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[132]
Do you think he…
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[133]:0,16
I don’t know.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[133]:16,51
His brain was intact when he died.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[133]:51,113
If he wasn’t in a body bag…if the ground was soft enough.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[133]:113,153
How long would it have taken to dig out?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[134]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[135]:0,42
[He chews another leaf, offering me some.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[135]:42,53
I decline.]
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[136]
And Mister Muller?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[137]:0,63
No explanation, not to his widow, not to the Austrian embassy.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[137]:63,137
Just another kidnapped tourist who’d been careless in a dangerous town.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[137]:137,238
I don’t know if Frau Muller ever believed that story, or if she ever tried to investigate further.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[137]:238,289
She probably never realized how damn lucky she was.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[138]
Why was she lucky?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[139]:0,17
Are you serious?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[139]:17,62
What if he hadn’t reanimated in my clinic?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[139]:62,113
What if he’d managed to make it all the way home?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[140]
Is that possible?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[141]:0,17
Of course it is!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[141]:17,33
Think about it.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[141]:33,197
Because the infection started in the heart, the virus had direct access to his circulatory system, so it probably reached his brain seconds after it was implanted.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[141]:197,281
Now you take another organ, a liver or a kidney, or even a section of grafted skin.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[141]:281,375
That’s going to take a lot longer, especially if the virus is only present in small amounts.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[142]
But the donor…
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[143]:0,39
Doesn’t have to be fully reanimated.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[143]:39,75
What if he’s just newly infected?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[143]:75,118
The organ may not be completely saturated.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[143]:118,161
It might only have an infinitesimal trace.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[143]:161,285
You put that organ in another body, it might take days, weeks, before it eventually works its way out into the bloodstream.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[143]:285,393
By that point the patient might be well on the way to recovery, happy and healthy and living a regular life.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[144]
But whoever is removing the organ…
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[145]:0,42
…may not know what he’s dealing with.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[145]:42,54
I didn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[145]:54,119
These were the very early stages, when nobody knew anything yet.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[145]:119,312
Even if they did know, like elements in the Chinese army…you want to talk about immoral…Years before the outbreak they’d been making millions on organs from executed political prisoners.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[145]:312,403
You think something like a little virus is going to make them stop sucking that golden tit?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[146]
But how…
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[147]:0,296
You remove the heart not long after the victim’s died…maybe even while he’s still alive…they used to do that, you know, remove living organs to ensure their freshness…pack it in ice, put it on a plane for Rio…China used to be the largest exporter of human organs on the world market.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[147]:296,448
Who knows how many infected corneas, infected pituitary glands…Mother of God, who knows how many infected kidneys they pumped into the global market.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[147]:448,478
And that’s just the organs!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[147]:478,572
You want to talk about the “donated” eggs from political prisoners, the sperm, the blood?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[147]:572,643
You think immigration was the only way the infection swept the planet?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[147]:643,697
Not all the initial outbreaks were Chinese nationals.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[147]:697,829
Can you explain all those stories of people suddenly dying of unexplained causes, then reanimating without ever having been bitten?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[147]:829,875
Why did so many outbreaks begin in hospitals?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[147]:875,932
Illegal Chinese immigrants weren’t going to hospitals.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[147]:932,1055
Do you know how many thousands of people got illegal organ transplants in those early years leading up to the Great Panic?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[147]:1055,1114
Even if 10 percent of them were infected, even 1 percent…
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[148]
Do you have any proof of this theory?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[149]:0,49
No…but that doesn’t mean it didn’t happen!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[149]:49,189
When I think about how many transplants I performed, all those patients from Europe, the Arab world, even the self-righteous United States.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[149]:189,358
Few of you Yankees asked where your new kidney or pancreas was coming from, be it a slum kid from the City of God or some unlucky student in a Chinese political prison.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[149]:358,396
You didn’t know, you didn’t care.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[149]:396,508
You just signed your traveler’s checks, went under the knife, then went home to Miami or New York or wherever.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[150]
Did you ever try to track these patients down, warn them?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[151]:0,16
No, I didn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[151]:16,112
I was trying to recover from a scandal, rebuild my reputation, my client base, my bank account.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[151]:112,174
I wanted to forget what happened, not investigate it further.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[151]:174,244
By the time I realized the danger, it was scratching at my front door.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[152]
BRIDGETOWN HARBOR, BARBADOS, WEST INDIES FEDERATION
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[153]:0,159
[I was told to expect a “tall ship,” although the “sails” of IS Imfingo refer to the four vertical wind turbines rising from her sleek, trimaran hull.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[153]:159,489
When coupled with banks of PEM, or proton exchange membrane, fuel cells, a technology that converts seawater into electricity, it is easy to see why the prefix “IS” stands for “Infinity Ship.” Hailed as the undisputed future of maritime transport, it is still rare to see one sailing under anything but a government flag.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[153]:489,534
The Imfingo is privately owned and operated.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[153]:534,563
Jacob Nyathi is her captain.]
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[154]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[155]:0,71
I was born about the same time as the new, postapartheid South Africa.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[155]:71,224
In those euphoric days, the new government not only promised the democracy of “one man, one vote,” but employment and housing to the entire country.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[155]:224,266
My father thought that meant immediately.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[155]:266,378
He didn’t understand that these were long-term goals to be achieved after years—generations—of hard work.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[155]:378,544
He thought that if we abandoned our tribal homeland and relocated to a city, there would be a brand-new house and high-paying jobs just sitting there waiting for us.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[155]:544,587
My father was a simple man, a day laborer.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[155]:587,684
I can’t blame him for his lack of formal education, his dream of a better life for his family.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[155]:684,771
And so we settled in Khayelitsha, one of the four main townships outside of Cape Town.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[155]:771,829
It was a life of grinding, hopeless, humiliating poverty.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[155]:829,849
It was my childhood.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[156]:0,61
The night it happened, I was walking home from the bus stop.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[156]:61,85
It was around five A.M.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[156]:85,147
and I’d just finished my shift waiting tables at the T.G.I.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[156]:147,177
Friday’s at Victoria Wharf.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[156]:177,203
It had been a good night.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[156]:203,309
The tips were big, and news from the Tri Nations was enough to make any South African feel ten feet tall.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[156]:309,362
The Springboks were trouncing the All Blacks…again!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[157]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[158]
[He smiles with the memory.]
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[159]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[160]:0,172
Maybe those thoughts were what distracted me at first, maybe it was simply being so knackered, but I felt my body instinctively react before I consciously heard the shots.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[160]:172,240
Gunfire was not unusual, not in my neighborhood, not in those days.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[160]:240,311
“One man, one gun,” that was the slogan of my life in Khayelitsha.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[160]:311,378
Like a combat veteran, you develop almost genetic survival skills.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[160]:378,401
Mine were razor sharp.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[160]:401,511
I crouched, tried to triangulate the sound, and at the same time look for the hardest surface to hide behind.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[160]:511,759
Most of the homes were just makeshift shanties, wood scraps or corrugated tin, or just sheets of plastic fastened to barely standing beams. Fire ravaged these lean-tos at least once a year, and bullets could pass through them as easily as open air.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:0,109
I sprinted and crouched behind a barbershop, which had been constructed from a car-sized shipping container.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:109,227
It wasn’t perfect, but it would do for a few seconds, long enough to hole up and wait for the shooting to die down.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:227,245
Only it didn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:245,350
Pistols, shotguns, and that clatter you never forget, the kind that tells you someone has a Kalashnikov.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:350,414
This was lasting much too long to be just an ordinary gang row.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:414,446
Now there were screams, shouts.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:446,470
I began to smell smoke.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:470,504
I heard the stirrings of a crowd.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:504,541
I peeked out from around the corner.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:541,616
Dozens of people, most of them in their nightclothes, all shouting “Run!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:616,634
Get out of there!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:634,726
They’re coming!” House lamps were lighting all around me, faces poking out of shanties.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:726,768
“What’s going on here?” they asked.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:768,820
“Who’s coming?” Those were the younger faces.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:820,863
The older ones, they just started running.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:863,982
They had a different kind of survival instinct, an instinct born in a time when they were slaves in their own country.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[161]:982,1102
In those days, everyone knew who “they” were, and if “they” were ever coming, all you could do was run and pray.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[162]
Did you run?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[163]:0,14
I couldn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[163]:14,166
My family, my mother and two little sisters, lived only a few “doors” down from the Radio Zibonele station, exactly where the mob was fleeing from.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[163]:166,187
I wasn’t thinking.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[163]:187,201
I was stupid.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[163]:201,267
I should have doubled back around, found an alley or quiet street.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[164]:0,68
I tried to wade through the mob, pushing in the opposite direction.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[164]:68,124
I thought I could stay along the sides of the shanties.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[164]:124,237
I was knocked into one, into one of their plastic walls that wrapped around me as the whole structure collapsed.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[164]:237,274
I was trapped, I couldn’t breathe.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[164]:274,328
Someone ran over me, smashed my head into the ground.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[164]:328,390
I shook myself free, wriggled and rolled out into the street.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[164]:390,504
I was still on my stomach when I saw them: ten or fifteen, silhouetted against the fires of the burning shanties.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[164]:504,565
I couldn’t see their faces, but I could hear them moaning.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[164]:565,627
They were slouching steadily toward me with their arms raised.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:0,56
I got to my feet, my head swam, my body ached all over.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:56,144
Instinctively I began to withdraw, backing into the “doorway” of the closest shack.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:144,216
Something grabbed me from behind, pulled at my collar, tore the fabric.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:216,249
I spun, ducked, and kicked hard.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:249,306
He was large, larger and heavier than me by a few kilos.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:306,357
Black fluid ran down the front of his white shirt.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:357,439
A knife protruded from his chest, jammed between the ribs and buried to the hilt.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:439,535
A scrap of my collar, which was clenched between his teeth, dropped as his lower jaw fell open.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:535,558
He growled, he lunged.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:558,576
I tried to dodge.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:576,597
He grabbed my wrist.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:597,647
I felt a crack, and pain shot up through my body.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:647,707
I dropped to my knees, tried to roll and maybe trip him up.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:707,752
My hand came up against a heavy cooking pot.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:752,781
I grabbed it and swung hard.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:781,807
It smashed into his face.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:807,922
I hit him again, and again, bashing his skull until the bone split open and the brains spilled out across my feet.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:922,939
He slumped over.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:939,1008
I freed myself just as another one of them appeared in the entrance.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:1008,1074
This time the structure’s flimsy nature worked to my advantage.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[165]:1074,1163
I kicked the back wall open, slinking out and bringing the whole hut down in the process.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:0,42
I ran, I didn’t know where I was going.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:42,119
It was a nightmare of shacks and fire and grasping hands all racing past me.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:119,182
I ran through a shanty where a woman was hiding in the corner.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:182,233
Her two children were huddled against her, crying.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:233,261
“Come with me!” I said.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:261,338
“Please, come, we have to go!” I held out my hands, moved closer to her.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:338,405
She pulled her children back, brandishing a sharpened screwdriver.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:405,433
Her eyes were wide, scared.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:433,525
I could hear sounds behind me…smashing through shanties, knocking them over as they came.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:525,559
I switched from Xhosa to English.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:559,649
“Please,” I begged, “you have to run!” I reached for her but she stabbed my hand.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:649,667
I left her there.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:667,700
I didn’t know what else to do.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:700,774
She is still in my memory, when I sleep or maybe close my eyes sometimes.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[166]:774,842
Sometimes she’s my mother, and the crying children are my sisters.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[167]:0,75
I saw a bright light up ahead, shining between the cracks in the shanties.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[167]:75,101
I ran as hard as I could.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[167]:101,126
I tried to call to them.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[167]:126,147
I was out of breath.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[167]:147,220
I crashed through the wall of a shack and suddenly I was in open ground.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[167]:220,250
The headlights were blinding.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[167]:250,290
I felt something slam into my shoulder.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[167]:290,337
I think I was out before I even hit the ground.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[168]:0,46
I came to in a bed at Groote Schuur Hospital.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[168]:46,104
I’d never seen the inside of a recovery ward like this.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[168]:104,131
It was so clean and white.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[168]:131,158
I thought I might be dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[168]:158,207
The medication, I’m sure, helped that feeling.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[168]:207,290
I’d never tried any kind of drugs before, never even touched a drink of alcohol.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[168]:290,365
I didn’t want to end up like so many in my neighborhood, like my father.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[168]:365,415
All my life I’d fought to stay clean, and now…
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[169]:0,70
The morphine or whatever they had pumped into my veins was delicious.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[169]:70,102
I didn’t care about anything.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[169]:102,176
I didn’t care when they told me the police had shot me in the shoulder.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[169]:176,270
I saw the man in the bed next to me frantically wheeled out as soon as his breathing stopped.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[169]:270,356
I didn’t even care when I overheard them talking about the outbreak of “rabies.”
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[170]
Who was talking about it?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[171]:0,16
I don’t know.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[171]:16,57
Like I said, I was as high as the stars.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[171]:57,141
I just remember voices in the hallway outside my ward, loud voices angrily arguing.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[171]:141,189
“That wasn’t rabies!” one of them yelled.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[171]:189,342
“Rabies doesn’t do that to people!” Then…something else…then “well, what the hell do you suggest, we’ve got fifteen downstairs right here!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[171]:342,497
Who knows how many more are still out there!” It’s funny, I go over that conversation all the time in my head, what I should have thought, felt, done.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[171]:497,584
It was a long time before I sobered up again, before I woke up and faced the nightmare.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[172]
TEL AVIV, ISRAEL
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[173]:0,109
[Jurgen Warmbrunn has a passion for Ethiopian food, which is our reason for meeting at a Falasha restaurant.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[173]:109,265
With his bright pink skin, and white, unruly eyebrows that match his “Einstein” hair, he might be mistaken for a crazed scientist or college professor.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[173]:265,280
He is neither.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[173]:280,455
Although never acknowledging which Israeli intelligence service he was, and possibly still is, employed by, he openly admits that at one point he could be called “a spy.”]
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[174]:0,71
Most people don’t believe something can happen until it already has.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[174]:71,135
That’s not stupidity or weakness, that’s just human nature.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[174]:135,177
I don’t blame anyone for not believing.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[174]:177,232
I don’t claim to be any smarter or better than them.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[174]:232,297
I guess what it really comes down to is the randomness of birth.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[174]:297,383
I happened to be born into a group of people who live in constant fear of extinction.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[174]:383,514
It’s part of our identity, part of our mind-set, and it has taught us through horrific trial and error to always be on our guard.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[175]:0,89
The first warning I had of the plague was from our friends and customers over in Taiwan.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[175]:89,154
They were complaining about our new software decryption program.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[175]:154,291
Apparently it was failing to decode some e-mails from PRC sources, or at least decoding them so poorly that the text was unintelligible.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[175]:291,387
I suspected the problem might not be in the software but in the translated messages themselves.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[175]:387,490
The mainland Reds…I guess they weren’t really Reds anymore but…what do you want from an old man?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[175]:490,605
The Reds had a nasty habit of using too many different computers from too many different generations and countries.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[176]:0,117
Before I suggested this theory to Taipei, I thought it might be a good idea to review the scrambled messages myself.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[176]:117,196
I was surprised to find that the characters themselves were perfectly decoded.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[176]:196,361
But the text itself…it all had to do with a new viral outbreak that first eliminated its victim, then reanimated his corpse into some kind of homicidal berzerker.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[176]:361,550
Of course, I didn’t believe this was true, especially because only a few weeks later the crisis in the Taiwan Strait began and any messages dealing with rampaging corpses abruptly ended.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[176]:550,614
I suspected a second layer of encryption, a code within a code.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[176]:614,703
That was pretty standard procedure, going back to the first days of human communication.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[176]:703,756
Of course the Reds didn’t mean actual dead bodies.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[176]:756,814
It had to be a new weapon system or ultrasecret war plan.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[176]:814,863
I let the matter drop, tried to forget about it.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[176]:863,955
Still, as one of your great national heroes used to say: “My spider sense was tingling.”
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[177]:0,153
Not long afterward, at the reception for my daughter’s wedding, I found myself speaking to one of my son-in-law’s professors from Hebrew University.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[177]:153,218
The man was a talker, and he’d had a little too much to drink.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[177]:218,442
He was rambling about how his cousin was doing some kind of work in South Africa and had told him some stories about golems. You know about the Golem, the old legend about a rabbi who breathes life into an inanimate statue?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[177]:442,497
Mary Shelley stole the idea for her book Frankenstein.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[177]:497,546
I didn’t say anything at first, just listened.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[177]:546,657
The man went on blathering about how these golems weren’t made from clay, nor were they docile and obedient.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[177]:657,739
As soon as he mentioned reanimating human bodies, I asked for the man’s number.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[177]:739,846
It turns out he had been in Cape Town on one of those “Adrenaline Tours,” shark feeding I think it was.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[178]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[179]
[He rolls his eyes.]
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[180]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[181]:0,178
Apparently the shark had obliged him, right in the tuchus, which is why he had been recovering at Groote Schuur when the first victims from Khayelitsha township were brought in.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[181]:178,294
He hadn’t seen any of these cases firsthand, but the staff had told him enough stories to fill my old Dictaphone.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[181]:294,384
I then presented his stories, along with those decrypted Chinese e-mails, to my superiors.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[182]:0,97
And this is where I directly benefited from the unique circumstances of our precarious security.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[182]:97,442
In October of 1973, when the Arab sneak attack almost drove us into the Mediterranean, we had all the intelligence in front of us, all the warning signs, and we had simply “dropped the ball.” We never considered the possibility of an all-out, coordinated, conventional assault from several nations, certainly not on our holiest of holidays.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[182]:442,520
Call it stagnation, call it rigidity, call it an unforgivable herd mentality.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[182]:520,648
Imagine a group of people all staring at writing on a wall, everyone congratulating one another on reading the words correctly.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[182]:648,730
But behind that group is a mirror whose image shows the writing’s true message.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[182]:730,758
No one looks at the mirror.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[182]:758,790
No one thinks it’s necessary.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[182]:790,962
Well, after almost allowing the Arabs to finish what Hitler started, we realized that not only was that mirror image necessary, but it must forever be our national policy.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[182]:962,1081
From 1973 onward, if nine intelligence analysts came to the same conclusion, it was the duty of the tenth to disagree.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[182]:1081,1171
No matter how unlikely or far-fetched a possibility might be, one must always dig deeper.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[182]:1171,1547
If a neighbor’s nuclear power plant might be used to make weapons-grade plutonium, you dig; if a dictator was rumored to be building a cannon so big it could fire anthrax shells across whole countries, you dig; and if there was even the slightest chance that dead bodies were being reanimated as ravenous killing machines, you dig and dig until you stike the absolute truth.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[183]:0,31
And that is what I did, I dug.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[183]:31,58
At first it wasn’t easy.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[183]:58,200
With China out of the picture…the Taiwan crisis put an end to any intelligence gathering…I was left with very few sources of information.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[183]:200,337
A lot of it was chaff, especially on the Internet; zombies from space and Area 51…what is your country’s fetish for Area 51, anyway?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[183]:337,482
After a while I started to uncover more useful data: cases of “rabies” similar to Cape Town…it wasn’t called African rabies until later.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[183]:482,592
I uncovered the psychological evaluations of some Canadian mountain troops recently returned from Kyrgyzstan.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[183]:592,699
I found the blog records of a Brazilian nurse who told her friends all about the murder of a heart surgeon.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[184]:0,72
The majority of my information came from the World Health Organization.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[184]:72,182
The UN is a bureaucratic masterpiece, so many nuggets of valuable data buried in mountains of unread reports.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[184]:182,277
I found incidents all over the world, all of them dismissed with “plausible” explanations.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[184]:277,356
These cases allowed me to piece together a cohesive mosaic of this new threat.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[184]:356,454
The subjects in question were indeed dead, they were hostile, and they were undeniably spreading.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[184]:454,531
I also made one very encouraging discovery: how to terminate their existence.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[185]
Going for the brain.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[186]:0,197
[He chuckles.] We talk about it today as if it is some feat of magic, like holy water or a silver bullet, but why wouldn’t destruction of the brain be the only way to annihilate these creatures?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[186]:197,246
Isn’t it the only way to annihilate us as well?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[187]
You mean human beings?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[188]:0,36
[He nods.] Isn’t that all we are?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[188]:36,114
Just a brain kept alive by a complex and vulnerable machine we call the body?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[188]:114,240
The brain cannot survive if just one part of the machine is destroyed or even deprived of such necessities as food or oxygen.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[188]:240,416
That is the only measurable difference between us and “The Undead.” Their brains do not require a support system to survive, so it is necessary to attack the organ itself.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[188]:416,542
[His right hand, in the shape of a gun, rises to touch his temple.] A simple solution, but only if we recognized the problem!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[188]:542,671
Given how quickly the plague was spreading, I thought it might be prudent to seek confirmation from foreign intelligence circles.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[189]:0,90
Paul Knight had been a friend of mine for a long time, going all the way back to Entebbe.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[189]:90,157
The idea to use a double of Amin’s black Mercedes, that was him.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[189]:157,310
Paul had retired from government service right before his agency’s “reforms” and gone to work for a private consulting firm in Bethesda, Maryland.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[189]:310,509
When I visited him at his home, I was shocked to find that not only had he been working on the very same project, on his own time, of course, but that his file was almost as thick and heavy as mine.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[189]:509,568
We sat up the whole night reading each other’s findings.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[189]:568,589
Neither of us spoke.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[189]:589,707
I don’t think we were even conscious of each other, the world around us, anything except the words before our eyes.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[189]:707,789
We finished almost at the same time, just as the sky began to lighten in the east.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[190]
Paul turned the last page, then looked to me and said very matter-of-factly, “This is pretty bad, huh?” I nodded, so did he, then followed up with “So what are we going to do about it?”
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[191]
And that is how the “Warmbrunn-Knight” report was written.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[192]:0,42
I wish people would stop calling it that.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[192]:42,268
There were fifteen other names on that report: virologists, intelligence operatives, military analysts, journalists, even one UN observer who’d been monitoring the elections in Jakarta when the first outbreak hit Indonesia.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[192]:268,398
Everyone was an expert in his or her field, everyone had come to their own similar conclusions before ever being contacted by us.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[192]:398,446
Our report was just under a hundred pages long.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[192]:446,592
It was concise, it was fully comprehensive, it was everything we thought we needed to make sure this outbreak never reached epidemic proportions.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[192]:592,820
I know a lot of credit has been heaped upon the South African war plan, and deservedly so, but if more people had read our report and worked to make its recommendations a reality, then that plan would have never needed to exist.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[193]:0,49
But some people did read and follow your report.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[193]:49,71
Your own government…
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[194]
Barely, and just look at the cost.

/html/body/div/div[1]/p[195]

[With his rugged looks and polished charm, Saladin Kader could be a movie star.

He is friendly but never obsequious, self-assured but never arrogant.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[196]:150,268
He is a professor of urban planning at Khalil Gibran University, and, naturally, the love of all his female students.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[196]:268,324
We sit under the statue of the university’s namesake.

/html/body/div/div[1]/p[196]:324,438
Like everything else in one of the Middle East’s most affluent cities, its polished bronze glitters in the sun.]

====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[198]:0,38
I was born and raised in Kuwait City.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[198]:38,165
My family was one of the few “lucky” ones not to be expelled after 1991, after Arafat sided with Saddam against the world.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[198]:165,216
We weren’t rich, but neither were we struggling.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[198]:216,299
I was comfortable, even sheltered, you might say, and oh did it show in my actions.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[199]:0,115
I watched the Al Jazeera broadcast from behind the counter at the Starbucks where I worked every day after school.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[199]:115,172
It was the afternoon rush hour and the place was packed.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[199]:172,230
You should have heard the uproar, the jeers and catcalls.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[199]:230,307
I’m sure our noise level matched that on the floor of the General Assembly.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[200]:0,57
Of course we thought it was a Zionist lie, who didn’t?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[200]:57,222
When the Israeli ambassador announced to the UN General Assembly that his country was enacting a policy of “voluntary quarantine,” what was I supposed to think?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[200]:222,378
Was I supposed to really believe his crazy story that African rabies was actually some new plague that transformed dead bodies into bloodthirsty cannibals?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[200]:378,485
How can you possibly believe that kind of foolishness, especially when it comes from your most hated enemy?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[201]:0,324
I didn’t even hear the second part of that fat bastard’s speech, the part about offering asylum, no questions asked, to any foreign-born Jew, any foreigner of Israeli-born parents, any Palestinian living in the formerly occupied territories, and any Palestinian whose family had once lived within the borders of Israel.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[201]:324,411
The last part applied to my family, refugees from the ’67 War of Zionist aggression.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[201]:411,576
At the heeding of the PLO leadership, we had fled our village believing we could return as soon as our Egyptian and Syrian brothers had swept the Jews into the sea.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[201]:576,677
I had never been to Israel, or what was about to be absorbed into the new state of Unified Palestine.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[202]
What did you think was behind the Israeli ruse?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[203]:0,240
Here’s what I thought: The Zionists have just been driven out of the occupied territories, they say they left voluntarily, just like Lebanon, and most recently the Gaza Strip, but really, just like before, we knew we’d driven them out.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[203]:240,577
They know that the next and final blow would destroy that illegal atrocity they call a country, and to prepare for that final blow, they’re attempting to recruit both foreign Jews as cannon fodder and…and—I thought I was so clever for figuring this part out—kidnapping as many Palestinians as they could to act as human shields!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[203]:577,600
I had all the answers.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[203]:600,627
Who doesn’t at seventeen?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[204]:0,74
My father wasn’t quite convinced of my ingenious geopolitical insights.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[204]:74,110
He was a janitor at Amiri Hospital.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[204]:110,188
He’d been on duty the night it had its first major African rabies outbreak.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[204]:188,404
He hadn’t personally seen the bodies rise from their slabs or the carnage of panicked patients and security guards, but he’d witnessed enough of the aftermath to convince him that staying in Kuwait was suicidal.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[204]:404,480
He’d made up his mind to leave the same day Israel made their declaration.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[205]
That must have been difficult to hear.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[206]:0,18
It was blasphemy!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[206]:18,92
I tried to make him see reason, to convince him with my adolescent logic.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[206]:92,232
I’d show the images from Al Jazeera, the images coming out of the new West Bank state of Palestine; the celebrations, the demonstrations.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[206]:232,289
Anyone with eyes could see total liberation was at hand.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[206]:289,423
The Israelis had withdrawn from all the occupied territory and were actually preparing to evacuate Al Quds, what they call Jerusalem!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[206]:423,590
All the factional fighting, the violence between our various resistance organizations, I knew that would die down once we unified for the final blow against the Jews.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[206]:590,621
Couldn’t my father see this?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[206]:621,762
Couldn’t he understand that, in a few years, a few months, we would be returning to our homeland, this time as liberators, not as refugees.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[207]
How was your argument resolved?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[208]:0,43
“Resolved,” what a pleasant euphemism.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[208]:43,121
It was “resolved” after the second outbreak, the larger one at Al Jahrah.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[208]:121,249
My father had just quit his job, cleared out our bank account, such as it was…our bags were packed…our e-tickets confirmed.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[208]:249,339
The TV was blaring in the background, riot police storming the front entrance of a house.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[208]:339,393
You couldn’t see what they were shooting at inside.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[208]:393,507
The official report blamed the violence on “pro-Western extremists.” My father and I were arguing, as always.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[208]:507,657
He tried to convince me of what he’d seen at the hospital, that by the time our leaders acknowledged the danger, it would be too late for any of us.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[209]:0,270
I, of course, scoffed at his timid ignorance, at his willingness to abandon “The Struggle.” What else could I expect from a man who’d spent his whole life scrubbing toilets in a country that treated our people only slightly better than its Filipino guest workers.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[209]:270,317
He’d lost his perspective, his self-respect.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[209]:317,429
The Zionists were offering the hollow promise of a better life, and he was jumping at it like a dog with scraps.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[210]
My father tried, with all the patience he could muster, to make me see that he had no more love for Israel than the most militant Al Aqsa martyr, but they seemed to be the only country actively preparing for the coming storm, certainly the only one that would so freely shelter and protect our family.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[211]:0,23
I laughed in his face.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[211]:23,213
Then I dropped the bomb: I told him that I’d already found a website for the Children of Yassin 1 and was waiting for an e-mail from a recruiter supposedly operating right in Kuwait City.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[211]:213,365
I told my father to go and be the yehud’s whore if he wanted, but the next time we’d meet was when I would be rescuing him from an internment camp.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[211]:365,435
I was quite proud of those words, I thought they sounded very heroic.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[211]:435,592
I glared in his face, stood from the table, and made my final pronouncement: “Surely the vilest of beasts in Allah’s sight are those who disbelieve!” 2
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[212]:0,46
The dinner table suddenly became very silent.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[212]:46,102
My mother looked down, my sisters looked at each other.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[212]:102,208
All you could hear was the TV, the frantic words of the on-site reporter telling everyone to remain calm.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[212]:208,239
My father was not a large man.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[212]:239,289
By that time, I think I was even bigger than him.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[212]:289,361
He was also not an angry man; I don’t think he ever raised his voice.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[212]:361,548
I saw something in his eyes, something I didn’t recognize, and then suddenly he was on me, a lightning whirlwind that threw me up against the wall, slapped me so hard my left ear rang.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[212]:548,658
“You WILL go!” he shouted as he grabbed my shoulders and repeatedly slammed me against the cheap drywall.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[212]:658,679
“I am your father!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[212]:679,745
You WILL OBEY ME!” His next slap sent my vision flashing white.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[212]:745,872
“YOU WILL LEAVE WITH THIS FAMILY OR YOU WILL NOT LEAVE THIS ROOM ALIVE!” More grabbing and shoving, shouting and slapping.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[212]:872,989
I didn’t understand where this man had come from, this lion who’d replaced my docile, frail excuse for a parent.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[212]:989,1017
A lion protecting his cubs.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[212]:1017,1169
He knew that fear was the only weapon he had left to save my life and if I didn’t fear the threat of the plague, then dammit, I was going to fear him!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[213]
Did it work?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[214]
[Laughs.] Some martyr I turned out to be, I think I cried all the way to Cairo.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[215]
Cairo?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[216]:0,126
There were no direct flights to Israel from Kuwait, not even from Egypt once the Arab League imposed its travel restrictions.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[216]:126,226
We had to fly from Kuwait to Cairo, then take a bus across the Sinai Desert to the crossing at Taba.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[217]:0,64
As we approached the border, I saw the Wall for the first time.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[217]:64,145
It was still unfinished, naked steel beams rising above the concrete foundation.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[217]:145,332
I’d known about the infamous “security fence”—what citizen of the Arab world didn’t—but I’d always been led to believe that it only surrounded the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[217]:332,477
Out here, in the middle of this barren desert, it only confirmed my theory that the Israelis were expecting an attack along their entire border.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[217]:477,494
Good, I thought.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[217]:494,546
The Egyptians have finally rediscovered their balls.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:0,123
At Taba, we were taken off the bus and told to walk, single file, past cages that held very large and fierce-looking dogs.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:123,146
We went one at a time.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:146,258
A border guard, this skinny black African—I didn’t know there were black Jews 3 —would hold out his hand.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:258,315
“Wait there!” he said in barely recognizable Arabic.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:315,368
Then, “you go, come!” The man before me was old.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:368,427
He had a long white beard and supported himself on a cane.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:427,540
As he passed the dogs, they went wild, howling and snarling, biting and charging at the confines of their cages.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:540,672
Instantly, two large chaps in civilian clothing were at the old man’s side, speaking something in his ear and escorting him away.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:672,705
I could see the man was injured.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:705,769
His dishdasha was torn at the hip and stained with brown blood.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:769,892
These men were certainly no doctors, however, and the black, unmarked van they escorted him to was certainly no ambulance.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:892,957
Bastards, I thought, as the old man’s family wailed after him.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:957,1021
Weeding out the ones too sick and old to be of any use to them.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:1021,1072
Then it was our turn to walk the gauntlet of dogs.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:1072,1125
They didn’t bark at me, nor the rest of my family.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:1125,1198
I think one of them even wagged its tail as my sister held out her hand.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:1198,1302
The next man after us, however…again came the barks and growls, again came the nondescript civilians.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:1302,1447
I turned to look at him and was surprised to see a white man, American maybe, or Canadian…no, he had to be American, his English was too loud.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:1447,1500
“C’mon, I’m fine!” He shouted and struggled.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:1500,1651
“C’mon, man, what the fuck?” He was well dressed, a suit and tie, matching luggage that was tossed aside as he began to fight with the Israelis.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:1651,1690
“Dude, c’mon, get the fuck off me!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:1690,1709
I’m one’a you!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:1709,1828
C’mon!” The buttons on his shirt ripped open, revealing a bloodstained bandage wrapped tightly around his stomach.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:1828,1909
He was still kicking and screaming as they dragged him into the back of the van.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:1909,1935
I didn’t understand it.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:1935,1953
Why these people?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:1953,2029
Clearly, it wasn’t just about being an Arab, or even about being wounded.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:2029,2123
I saw several refugees with severe injuries pass through without molestation from the guards.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:2123,2206
They were all escorted to waiting ambulances, real ambulances, not the black vans.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:2206,2251
I knew it had something to do with the dogs.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:2251,2283
Were they screening for rabies?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[218]:2283,2386
That made the most sense to me, and it continued to be my theory during our internment outside Yeroham.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[219]
The resettlement camp?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[220]:0,29
Resettlement and quarantine.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[220]:29,70
At that time, I just saw it as a prison.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[220]:70,219
It was exactly what I’d expected to happen to us: the tents, the overcrowding, the guards, barbed wire, and the seething, baking Negev Desert sun.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[220]:219,391
We felt like prisoners, we were prisoners, and although I would have never had the courage to say to my father “I told you so,” he could see it clearly in my sour face.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[221]:0,100
What I didn’t expect was the physical examinations; every day, from an army of medical personnel.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[221]:100,184
Blood, skin, hair, saliva, even urine and feces 4 …it was exhausting, mortifying.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[221]:184,394
The only thing that made it bearable, and probably what prevented an all-out riot among some of the Muslim detainees, was that most of the doctors and nurses doing the examinations were themselves Palestinian.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[221]:394,504
The doctor who examined my mother and sisters was a woman, an American woman from a place called Jersey City.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[221]:504,612
The man who examined us was from Jabaliya in Gaza and had himself been a detainee only a few months before.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[221]:612,677
He kept telling us, “You made the right decision to come here.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[221]:677,691
You’ll see.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[221]:691,814
I know it’s hard, but you’ll see it was the only way.” He told us it was all true, everything the Israelis had said.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[221]:814,905
I still couldn’t bring myself to believe him, even though a growing part of me wanted to.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[222]:0,116
We stayed at Yeroham for three weeks, until our papers were processed and our medical examinations finally cleared.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[222]:116,184
You know, the whole time they barely even glanced at our passports.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[222]:184,268
My father had done all this work to make sure our official documents were in order.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[222]:268,301
I don’t think they even cared.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[222]:301,452
Unless the Israeli Defense Force or the police wanted you for some previous “unkosher” activities, all that mattered was your clean bill of health.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[223]:0,171
The Ministry of Social Affairs provided us with vouchers for subsidized housing, free schooling, and a job for my father at a salary that would support the entire family.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[223]:171,246
This is too good to be true, I thought as we boarded the bus for Tel Aviv.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[223]:246,286
The hammer is going to fall anytime now.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[224]:0,48
It did once we entered the city of Beer Sheeba.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[224]:48,130
I was asleep, I didn’t hear the shots or see the driver’s windscreen shatter.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[224]:130,186
I jerked awake as I felt the bus swerve out of control.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[224]:186,226
We crashed into the side of a building.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[224]:226,276
People screamed, glass and blood were everywhere.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[224]:276,319
My family was close to the emergency exit.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[224]:319,384
My father kicked the door open and pushed us out into the street.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[225]:0,48
There was shooting, from the windows, doorways.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[225]:48,138
I could see that it was soldiers versus civilians, civilians with guns or homemade bombs.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[225]:138,150
This is it!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[225]:150,161
I thought.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[225]:161,203
My heart felt like it was going to burst!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[225]:203,232
This liberation has started!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[225]:232,380
Before I could do anything, run out to join my comrades in battle, someone had me by my shirt and was pulling me through the doorway of a Starbucks.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[226]:0,112
I was thrown on the floor next to my family, my sisters were crying as my mother tried to crawl on top of them.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[226]:112,158
My father had a bullet wound in the shoulder.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[226]:158,236
An IDF soldier shoved me on the ground, keeping my face away from the window.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[226]:236,380
My blood was boiling; I started looking for something I could use as a weapon, maybe a large shard of glass to ram through the yehud’s throat.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[227]:0,104
Suddenly a door at the back of the Starbucks swung open, the soldier turned in its direction and fired.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[227]:104,195
A bloody corpse hit the floor right beside us, a grenade rolled out of his twitching hand.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[227]:195,262
The soldier grabbed the bomb and tried to hurl it into the street.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[227]:262,285
It exploded in midair.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[227]:285,322
His body shielded us from the blast.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[227]:322,380
He tumbled back over the corpse of my slain Arab brother.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[227]:380,413
Only he wasn’t an Arab at all.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[227]:413,540
As my tears dried I noticed that he wore payess and a yarmulke and bloody tzitzit snaked out from his damp, shredded trousers.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[227]:540,606
This man was a Jew, the armed rebels out in the street were Jews!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[227]:606,733
The battle raging all around us wasn’t an uprising by Palestinian insurgents, but the opening shots of the Israeli Civil War.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[228]
In your opinion, what do you believe was the cause of that war?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[229]:0,32
I think there were many causes.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[229]:32,134
I know the repatriation of Palestinians was unpopular, so was the general pullout from the West Bank.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[229]:134,237
I’m sure the Strategic Hamlet Resettlement Program must have inflamed more than its share of hearts.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[229]:237,372
A lot of Israelis had to watch their houses bulldozed in order to make way for those fortified, self-sufficient residential compounds.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[229]:372,419
Al Quds, I believe…that was the final straw.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[229]:419,563
The Coalition Government decided that it was the one major weak point, too large to control and a hole that led right into the heart of Israel.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[229]:563,647
They not only evacuated the city, but the entire Nablus to Hebron corridor as well.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[229]:647,838
They believed that rebuilding a shorter wall along the 1967 demarcation line was the only way to ensure physical security, no matter what backlash might occur from their own religious right.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[229]:838,1093
I learned all this much later, you understand, as well as the fact that the only reason the IDF eventually triumphed was because the majority of the rebels came from the ranks of the Ultra-Orthodox and therefore most had never served in the armed forces.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[229]:1093,1112
Did you know that?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[229]:1112,1124
I didn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[229]:1124,1219
I realized I practically didn’t know anything about these people I’d hated my entire life.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[229]:1219,1317
Everything I thought was true went up in smoke that day, supplanted by the face of our real enemy.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[230]:0,121
I was running with my family into the back of an Israeli tank, 5 when one of those unmarked vans came around the corner.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[230]:121,170
A handheld rocket slammed right into its engine.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[230]:170,271
The van catapulted into the air, crashed upside down, and exploded into a brilliant orange fireball.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[230]:271,388
I still had a few steps to go before reaching the doors of the tank, just enough time to see the whole event unfold.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[230]:388,514
Figures were climbing out of the burning wreckage, slow-moving torches whose clothes and skin were covered in burning petrol.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[230]:514,566
The soldiers around us began firing at the figures.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[230]:566,657
I could see little pops in their chests where the bullets were passing harmlessly through.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[230]:657,706
The squad leader next to me shouted “B’rosh!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[230]:706,762
Yoreh B’rosh!” and the soldiers adjusted their aim.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[230]:762,812
The figures’…the creatures’ heads exploded.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[230]:812,907
The petrol was just burning out as they hit the ground, these charred black, headless corpses.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[230]:907,1049
Suddenly I understood what my father had been trying to warn me about, what the Israelis had been trying to warn the rest of the world about!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[230]:1049,1127
What I couldn’t understand was why the rest of the world wasn’t listening.

[The office of the director of the Central Intelligence Agency could belong to a business executive or doctor or an everyday, small-town high school principal.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[234]:160,341
There are the usual collection of reference books on the shelf, degrees and photos on the wall, and, on his desk, an autographed baseball from Cincinnati Reds catcher Johnny Bench.

Bob Archer, my host, can see by my face that I was expecting something different.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[234]:423,485
I suspect that is why he chose to conduct our interview here.]
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[235]:0,95
When you think about the CIA, you probably imagine two of our most popular and enduring myths.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[235]:95,260
The first is that our mission is to search the globe for any conceivable threat to the United States, and the second is that we have the power to perform the first.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[235]:260,370
This myth is the by-product of an organization, which, by its very nature, must exist and operate in secrecy.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[235]:370,444
Secrecy is a vacuum and nothing fills a vacuum like paranoid speculation.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[235]:444,510
“Hey, did you hear who killed so and so, I hear it was the CIA.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[235]:510,584
Hey, what about that coup in El Banana Republico, must have been the CIA.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[235]:584,828
Hey, be careful looking at that website, you know who keeps a record of every website anyone’s ever looked at ever, the CIA!” This is the image most people had of us before the war, and it’s an image we were more than happy to encourage.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[235]:828,938
We wanted bad guys to suspect us, to fear us and maybe think twice before trying to harm any of our citizens.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[235]:938,1010
This was the advantage of our image as some kind of omniscient octopus.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[235]:1010,1244
The only disadvantage was that our own people believed in that image as well, so whenever anything, anywhere occurred without any warning, where do you think the finger was pointed: “Hey, how did that crazy country get those nukes?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[235]:1244,1263
Where was the CIA?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[235]:1263,1320
How come all those people were murdered by that fanatic?

Where was the CIA?

How come, when the dead began coming back to life, we didn’t know about it until they were breaking through our living room windows?

Where the hell was the goddamn CIA!?!”
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[236]:0,105
The truth was, neither the Central Intelligence Agency nor any of the other official and unofficial U.S.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[236]:105,204
intelligence organizations have ever been some kind of all-seeing, all-knowing, global illuminati.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[236]:204,253
For starters, we never had that kind of funding.

Even during the blank check days of the cold war, it’s just not physically possible to have eyes and ears in every back room, cave, alley, brothel, bunker, office, home, car, and rice paddy across the entire planet.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[236]:471,644
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not saying we were impotent, and maybe we can take credit for some of the things our fans, and our critics, have suspected us of over the years.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[236]:644,883
But if you add up all the crackpot conspiracy theories from Pearl Harbor 1 to the day before the Great Panic, then you’d have an organization not only more powerful than the United States, but the united efforts of the entire human race.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[237]:0,78
We’re not some shadow superpower with ancient secrets and alien technology.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[237]:78,218
We have very real limitations and extremely finite assets, so why would we waste those assets chasing down each and every potential threat?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[237]:218,297
That goes to the second myth of what an intelligence organization really does.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[237]:297,400
We can’t just spread ourselves thin looking for, and hoping to stumble on, new and possible dangers.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[237]:400,495
Instead, we’ve always had to identify and focus on those that are already clear and present.

If your Soviet neighbor is trying to set fire to your house, you can’t be worrying about the Arab down the block.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[237]:611,936
If suddenly it’s the Arab in your backyard, you can’t be worrying about the People’s Republic of China, and if one day the ChiComs show up at your front door with an eviction notice in one hand and a Molotov cocktail in the other, then the last thing you’re going to do is look over his shoulder for a walking corpse.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[238]
But didn’t the plague originate in China?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[239]
It did, as well as did one of the greatest single Maskirovkas in the history of modern espionage.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[240]
I’m sorry?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[241]:0,30
It was deception, a fake out.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[241]:30,97
The PRC knew they were already our number-one surveillance target.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[241]:97,195
They knew they could never hide the existence of their nationwide “Health and Safety” sweeps.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[241]:195,287
They realized that the best way to mask what they were doing was to hide it in plain sight.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[241]:287,382
Instead of lying about the sweeps themselves, they just lied about what they were sweeping for.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[242]
The dissident crackdown?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[243]:0,362
Bigger, the whole Taiwan Strait incident: the victory of the Taiwan National Independence Party, the assassination of the PRC defense minister, the buildup, the war threats, the demonstrations and subsequent crackdowns were all engineered by the Ministry of State Security and all of it was to divert the world’s eye from the real danger growing within China.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[243]:362,377
And it worked!
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[243]:377,568
Every shred of intel we had on the PRC, the sudden disappearances, the mass executions, the curfews, the reserve call-ups—everything could easily be explained as standard ChiCom procedure.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[243]:568,784
In fact, it worked so well, we were so convinced that World War III was about to break out in the Taiwan Strait, that we diverted other intel assets from countries where undead outbreaks were just starting to unfold.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[244]
The Chinese were that good.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[245]:0,22
And we were that bad.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[245]:22,62
It wasn’t the Agency’s finest hour.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[245]:62,102
We were still reeling from the purges…
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[246]
You mean the reforms?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[247]:0,56
No, I mean the purges, because that’s what they were.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[247]:56,321
When Joe Stalin either shot or imprisoned his best military commanders, he wasn’t doing half as much damage to his national security as what that administration did to us with their “reforms.” The last brushfire war was a debacle and guess who took the fall.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[247]:321,525
We’d been ordered to justify a political agenda, then when that agenda became a political liability, those who’d originally given the order now stood back with the crowd and pointed the finger at us.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[247]:525,580
“Who told us we should go to war in the first place?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[247]:580,614
Who mixed us up in all this mess?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[247]:614,694
The CIA!” We couldn’t defend ourselves without violating national security.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[247]:694,732
We had to just sit there and take it.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[247]:732,757
And what was the result?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[247]:757,770
Brain drain.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[247]:770,994
Why stick around and be the victim of a political witch hunt when you could escape to the private sector: a fatter paycheck, decent hours, and maybe, just maybe, a little respect and appreciation by the people you work for.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[247]:994,1100
We lost a lot of good men and women, a lot of experience, initiative, and priceless analytical reasoning.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[247]:1100,1177
All we were left with were the dregs, a bunch of brownnosing, myopic eunuchs.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[248]
But that couldn’t have been everyone.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[249]:0,19
No, of course not.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[249]:19,104
There were some of us who stayed because we actually believed in what we were doing.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[249]:104,198
We weren’t in this for money or working conditions, or even the occasional pat on the back.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[249]:198,254
We were in this because we wanted to serve our country.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[249]:254,289
We wanted to keep our people safe.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[249]:289,445
But even with ideals like that there comes a point when you have to realize that the sum of all your blood, sweat, and tears will ultimately amount to zero.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[250]
So you knew what was really happening.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[251]:0,24
No…no…I couldn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[251]:24,54
There was no way to confirm…
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[252]
But you had suspicions.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[253]
I had…doubts.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[254]
Could you be more specific?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[255]:0,17
No, I’m sorry.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[255]:17,93
But I can say that I broached the subject a number of times to my coworkers.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[256]
What happened?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[257]
The answer was always the same, “Your funeral.”
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[258]
And was it?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[259]:0,112
[Nods.] I spoke to…someone in a position of authority…just a five-minute meeting, expressing some concerns.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[259]:112,184
He thanked me for coming in and told me he’d look into it right away.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[259]:184,261
The next day I received transfer orders: Buenos Aires, effective immediately.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[260]
Did you ever hear of the Warmbrunn-Knight report?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[261]:0,273
Sure now, but back then…the copy that was originally hand delivered by Paul Knight himself, the one marked “Eyes Only” for the director…it was found at the bottom of the desk of a clerk in the San Antonio field office of the FBI, three years after the Great Panic.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[261]:273,459
It turned out to be academic because right after I was transferred, Israel went public with its statement of “Voluntary Quarantine.” Suddenly the time for advanced warning was over.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[261]:459,527
The facts were out; it was now a question of who would believe them.

[It is spring, “hunting season.” As the weather warms, and the bodies of frozen zombies begin to reanimate, elements of the UN N-For (Northern Force) have arrived for their annual “Sweep and Clear.” Every year the undead’s numbers dwindle.

Throughout our interview, he struggles to maintain eye contact.]
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[264]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[265]:0,35
I won’t deny mistakes were made.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[265]:35,86
I won’t deny we could have been better prepared.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[265]:86,157
I’ll be the first one to admit that we let the American people down.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[265]:157,201
I just want the American people to know why.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[266]:0,140
“What if the Israelis are right?” Those were the first words out of the chairman’s mouth the morning after Israel’s UN declaration.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[266]:140,282
“I’m not saying they are,” he made sure to stress that point, “I’m just saying, what if?” He wanted candid, not canned, opinions.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[266]:282,341
He was that type of man, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[266]:341,458
He kept the conversation “hypothetical,” indulging in the fantasy that this was just some intellectual exercise.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[266]:458,587
After all, if the rest of the world wasn’t ready to believe something so outrageous, why should the men and women in this room?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[267]:0,145
We kept up with the charade as long as we could, speaking with a smile or punctuating with a joke…I’m not sure when the transition happened.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[267]:145,462
It was so subtle, I don’t think anyone even noticed, but suddenly you had a room full of military professionals, each one with decades of combat experience and more academic training than the average civilian brain surgeon, and all of us speaking openly, and honestly, about the possible threat of walking corpses.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[267]:462,558
It was like…a dam breaking; the taboo was shattered, and the truth just started flooding out.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[267]:558,578
It was…liberating.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[268]
So you had had your own private suspicions?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[269]:0,64
For months before the Israeli declaration; so had the chairman.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[269]:64,130
Everyone in that room had heard something, or suspected something.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[270]
Had any of you read the Warmbrunn-Knight report?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[271]:0,16
No, none of us.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[271]:16,73
I had heard the name, but had no idea about its content.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[271]:73,146
I actually got my hands on a copy about two years after the Great Panic.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[271]:146,223
Most of its military measures were almost line for line in step with our own.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[272]
Your own what?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[273]:0,33
Our proposal to the White House.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[273]:33,195
We outlined a fully comprehensive program, not only to eliminate the threat within the United States, but to roll back and contain it throughout the entire world.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[274]
What happened?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[275]:0,33
The White House loved Phase One.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[275]:33,99
It was cheap, fast, and if executed properly, 100 percent covert.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[275]:99,177
Phase One involved the insertion of Special Forces units into infested areas.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[275]:177,234
Their orders were to investigate, isolate, and eliminate.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[276]
Eliminate?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[277]
With extreme prejudice.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[278]
Those were the Alpha teams?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[279]:0,46
Yes, sir, and they were extremely successful.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[279]:46,219
Even though their battle record is sealed for the next 140 years, I can say that it remains one of the most outstanding moments in the history of America’s elite warriors.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[280]
So what went wrong?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[281]:0,89
Nothing, with Phase One, but the Alpha teams were only supposed to be a stopgap measure.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[281]:89,191
Their mission was never to extinguish the threat, only delay it long enough to buy time for Phase Two.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[282]
But Phase Two was never completed.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[283]
Never even begun, and herein lies the reason why the American military was caught so shamefully unprepared.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[284]:0,137
Phase Two required a massive national undertaking, the likes of which hadn’t been seen since the darkest days of the Second World War.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[284]:137,280
That kind of effort requires Herculean amounts of both national treasure and national support, both of which, by that point, were nonexistent.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[284]:280,355
The American people had just been through a very long and bloody conflict.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[284]:355,372
They were tired.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[284]:372,393
They’d had enough.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[284]:393,482
Like the 1970s, the pendulum was swinging from a militant stance to a very resentful one.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:0,101
In totalitarian regimes—communism, fascism, religious fundamentalism—popular support is a given.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:101,265
You can start wars, you can prolong them, you can put anyone in uniform for any length of time without ever having to worry about the slightest political backlash.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:265,309
In a democracy, the polar opposite is true.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:309,373
Public support must be husbanded as a finite national resource.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:373,458
It must be spent wisely, sparingly, and with the greatest return on your investment.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:458,572
America is especially sensitive to war weariness, and nothing brings on a backlash like the perception of defeat.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:572,645
I say “perception” because America is a very all-or-nothing society.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:645,714
We like the big win, the touchdown, the knockout in the first round.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:714,837
We like to know, and for everyone else to know, that our victory wasn’t only uncontested, it was positively devastating.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:837,893
If not…well…look at where we were before the Panic.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:893,952
We didn’t lose the last brushfire conflict, far from it.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:952,1070
We actually accomplished a very difficult task with very few resources and under extremely unfavorable circumstances.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:1070,1198
We won, but the public didn’t see it that way because it wasn’t the blitzkrieg smackdown that our national spirit demanded.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:1198,1309
Too much time had gone by, too much money had been spent, too many lives had been lost or irrevocably damaged.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[285]:1309,1386
We’d not only squandered all our public support, we were deeply in the red.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[286]:0,48
Think about just the dollar value of Phase Two.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[286]:48,123
Do you know the price tag of putting just one American citizen in uniform?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[286]:123,279
And I don’t just mean the time that he’s actively in that uniform: the training, the equipment, the food, the housing, the transport, the medical care.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[286]:279,435
I’m talking about the long-term dollar value that the country, the American taxpayer, has to shell out to that person for the rest of their natural life.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[286]:435,543
This is a crushing financial burden, and in those days we barely had enough funding to maintain what we had.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[287]:0,185
Even if the coffers hadn’t been empty, if we’d had all the money to make all the uniforms we needed to implement Phase Two, who do you think we could have conned into filling them?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[287]:185,238
This goes to the heart of America’s war weariness.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[287]:238,490
As if the “traditional” horrors weren’t bad enough—the dead, the disfigured, the psychologically destroyed—now you had a whole new breed of difficulties, “The Betrayed.” We were a volunteer army, and look what happened to our volunteers.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[287]:490,689
How many stories do you remember about some soldier who had his term of service extended, or some exreservist who, after ten years of civilian life, suddenly found himself recalled into active duty?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[287]:689,742
How many weekend warriors lost their jobs or houses?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[287]:742,816
How many came back to ruined lives, or, worse, didn’t come back at all?
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[287]:816,871
Americans are an honest people, we expect a fair deal.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[287]:871,1002
I know that a lot of other cultures used to think that was naïve and even childish, but it’s one of our most sacred principles.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[287]:1002,1103
To see Uncle Sam going back on his word, revoking people’s private lives, revoking their freedom…
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[288]:0,155
After Vietnam, when I was a young platoon leader in West Germany, we’d had to institute an incentives program just to keep our soldiers from going AWOL.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[288]:155,332
After this last war, no amount of incentives could fill our depleted ranks, no payment bonuses or term reductions, or online recruiting tools disguised as civilian video games.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[288]:332,480
1 This generation had had enough, and that’s why when the undead began to devour our country, we were almost too weak and vulnerable to stop them.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[289]:0,127
I’m not blaming the civilian leadership and I’m not suggesting that we in uniform should be anything but beholden to them.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[289]:127,180
This is our system and it’s the best in the world.
====
/html/body/div/div[1]/p[289]:180,257
But it must be protected, and defended, and it must never again be so abused.

Situated near the planet’s southern geomagnetic pole, atop the four-kilometer ice crust of Lake Vostok, temperatures here have been recorded at a world record negative eighty-nine degrees Celsius, with the highs rarely reaching above negative twenty-two.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[2]:329,496
This extreme cold, and the fact that overland transport takes over a month to reach the station, were what made Vostok so attractive to Breckinridge “Breck” Scott.

====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[5]:492,516
“What are you seeing?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[5]:516,547
People selling their products?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[5]:547,551
No.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[5]:551,651
People selling the fear of you having to live without their products.” Fuckin’ A, was he right.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[5]:651,720
Fear of aging, fear of loneliness, fear of poverty, fear of failure.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[5]:720,760
Fear is the most basic emotion we have.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[5]:760,776
Fear is primal.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[5]:776,788
Fear sells.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[5]:788,808
That was my mantra.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[5]:808,825
“Fear sells.”
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[6]:0,123
When I first heard about the outbreaks, back when it was still called African rabies, I saw the opportunity of a lifetime.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[6]:123,317
I’ll never forget that first report, the Cape Town outbreak, only ten minutes of actual reporting then a full hour of speculating about what would happen if the virus ever made it to America.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[6]:317,337
God bless the news.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[6]:337,375
I hit speed dial thirty seconds later.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[7]:0,43
I met with some of my nearest and dearest.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[7]:43,78
They’d all seen the same report.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[7]:78,170
I was the first one to come up with a workable pitch: a vaccine, a real vaccine for rabies.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[7]:170,209
Thank God there is no cure for rabies.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[7]:209,282
A cure would make people buy it only if they thought they were infected.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[7]:282,297
But a vaccine!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[7]:297,320
That’s preventative!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[7]:320,394
People will keep taking that as long as they’re afraid it’s out there!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[8]:0,96
We had plenty of contacts in the biomed industry, with plenty more up on the Hill and Penn Ave.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[8]:96,198
We could have a working proto in less than a month and a proposal written up within a couple of days.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[8]:198,251
By the eighteenth hole, it was handshakes all around.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[9]
What about the FDA?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[10]:0,25
Please, are you serious?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[10]:25,117
Back then the FDA was one of the most underfunded, mismanaged organizations in the country.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[10]:117,174
I think they were still high-fiving over getting Red No.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[10]:174,277
2 1 out of M&Ms. Plus, this was one of the most business-friendly administrations in American history.

Rockefeller were getting wood from beyond the grave for this guy in the White House.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[10]:387,454
His staff didn’t even bother to read our cost assessment report.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[10]:454,508
I think they were already looking for a magic bullet.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[10]:508,558
They railroaded it through the FDA in two months.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[10]:558,728
Remember the speech the prez made before Congress, how it had been tested in Europe for some time and the only thing holding it up was our own “bloated bureaucracy”?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[10]:728,925
Remember the whole thing about “people don’t need big government, they need big protection, and they need it big-time!” Jesus Christmas, I think half the country creamed their pants at that.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[10]:925,989
How high did his approval rating go that night, 60 percent, 70?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[10]:989,1054
I just know that it jacked our IPO 389 percent on the first day!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[10]:1054,1082
Suck on that, Baidu dot-com!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[11]
And you didn’t know if it would work?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[12]
We knew it would work against rabies, and that’s what they said it was, right, just some weird strain of jungle rabies.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[13]
Who said that?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[14]:0,54
You know, “they,” like, the UN or the…somebody.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[14]:54,126
That’s what everyone ended up calling it, right, “African rabies.”
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[15]
Was it ever tested on an actual victim?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[16]:0,5
Why?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[16]:5,95
People used to take flu shots all the time, never knowing if it was for the right strain.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[16]:95,122
Why was this any different?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[17]
But the damage…
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[18]:0,41
Who thought it was going to go that far?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[18]:41,92
You know how many disease scares there used to be.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[18]:92,203
Jesus, you’d think the Black Death was sweeping the globe every three months or so…ebola, SARS, avian flu.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[18]:203,256
You know how many people made money on those scares?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[18]:256,346
Shit, I made my first million on useless antiradiation pills during the dirty bomb scares.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[19]
But if someone discovered…
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[20]:0,17
Discovered what?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[20]:17,48
We never lied, you understand?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[20]:48,109
They told us it was rabies, so we made a vaccine for rabies.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[20]:109,204
We said it had been tested in Europe, and the drugs it was based on had been tested in Europe.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[20]:204,232
Technically, we never lied.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[20]:232,273
Technically, we never did anything wrong.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[21]
But if someone discovered that it wasn’t rabies…
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[22]:0,35
Who was going to blow the whistle?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[22]:35,59
The medical profession?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[22]:59,144
We made sure it was a prescription drug so doctors stood just as much to lose as us.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[22]:144,154
Who else?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[22]:154,179
The FDA who let it pass?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[22]:179,229
The congressmen who all voted for its acceptance?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[22]:229,250
The surgeon general?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[22]:250,267
The White House?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[22]:267,297
This was a win-win situation!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[22]:297,352
Everyone got to be heroes, everyone got to make money.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[22]:352,528
Six months after Phalanx hit the market, you started getting all these cheaper, knockoff brands, all solid sellers as well as the other ancillary stuff like home air purifiers.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[23]
But the virus wasn’t airborne.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[24]:0,20
It didn’t matter!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[24]:20,54
It still had the same brand name!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[24]:54,157
“From the Makers of…” All I had to say was “May Prevent Some Viral Infections.” That was it!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[24]:157,236
Now I understand why it used to be illegal to shout fire in a crowded theater.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[24]:236,369
People weren’t going to say “Hey, I don’t smell smoke, is there really a fire,” no, they say “Holy shit, there’s a fire!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[24]:369,526
RUN!” [Laughs.] I made money on home purifiers, car purifiers; my biggest seller was this little doodad you wore around your neck when you got on a plane!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[24]:526,582
I don’t know if it even filtered ragweed, but it sold.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[25]:0,141
Things got so good, I started setting up these dummy companies, you know, with plans to build manufacturing facilities all over the country.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[25]:141,209
The shares from these dumbos sold almost as much as the real stuff.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[25]:209,293
It wasn’t even the idea of safety anymore, it was the idea of the idea of safety!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[25]:293,453
Remember when we started to get our first cases here in the States, that guy in Florida who said he’d been bitten but survived because he was taking Phalanx?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[25]:453,457
OH!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[25]:457,558
[He stands, mimes the act of frantic fornication.] God freakin’ bless that dumbass, whoever he was.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[26]:0,38
But that wasn’t because of Phalanx.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[26]:38,79
Your drug didn’t protect people at all.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[27]:0,36
It protected them from their fears.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[27]:36,64
That’s all I was selling.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[27]:64,294
Hell, because of Phalanx, the biomed sector started to recover, which, in turn, jump-started the stock market, which then gave the impression of a recovery, which then restored consumer confidence to stimulate an actual recovery!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[27]:294,334
Phalanx hands down ended the recession!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[27]:334,360
I…I ended the recession!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[28]:0,10
And then?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[28]:10,111
When the outbreaks became more serious, and the press finally reported that there was no wonder drug?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[29]:0,20
Pre-fucking-cisely!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[29]:20,111
That’s the alpha cunt who should be shot, what’s her name, who first broke that story!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[29]:111,130
Look what she did!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[29]:130,184
Pulled the fuckin’ rug right out from under us all!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[29]:184,207
She caused the spiral!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[29]:207,234
She caused the Great Panic!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[30]
And you take no personal responsibility?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[31]:0,10
For what?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[31]:10,77
For making a little fuckin’ cash…well, not a little [giggles].
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[31]:77,131
All I did was what any of us are ever supposed to do.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[31]:131,170
I chased my dream, and I got my slice.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[31]:170,300
You wanna blame someone, blame whoever first called it rabies, or who knew it wasn’t rabies and gave us the green light anyway.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[31]:300,452
Shit, you wanna blame someone, why not start with all the sheep who forked over their greenbacks without bothering to do a little responsible research.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[31]:452,487
I never held a gun to their heads.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[31]:487,520
They made the choice themselves.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[31]:520,552
They’re the bad guys, not me.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[31]:552,653
I never directly hurt anybody, and if anybody was too stupid to get themselves hurt, boo-fuckin-hoo.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[31]:653,665
Of course…
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[32]:0,130
If there’s a hell…[giggles as he talks]…I don’t want to think about how many of those dumb shits might be waiting for me.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[32]:130,169
I just hope they don’t want a refund.

====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[36]:0,92
Of course we got our copy of the Knight-WarnJews report, what do you think we are, the CIA?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[36]:92,149
We read it three months before the Israelis went public.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[36]:149,309
Before the Pentagon started making noise, it was my job to personally brief the president, who in turn even devoted an entire meeting to discussing its message.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[37]
Which was?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[38]:0,63
Drop everything, focus all our efforts, typical alarmist crap.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[38]:63,240
We got dozens of these reports a week, every administration did, all of them claiming that their particular boogeyman was “the greatest threat to human existence.” C’mon!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[38]:240,435
Can you imagine what America would have been like if the federal government slammed on the brakes every time some paranoid crackpot cried “wolf” or “global warming” or “living dead”?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[38]:435,443
Please.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[38]:443,602
What we did, what every president since Washington has done, was provide a measured, appropriate response, in direct relation to a realistic threat assessment.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[39]
And that was the Alpha teams.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[40]:0,21
Among others things.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[40]:21,154
Given how low a priority the national security adviser thought this was, I think we actually gave it some pretty healthy table time.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[40]:154,264
We produced an educational video for state and local law enforcement about what to do in case of an outbreak.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[40]:264,394
The Department of Health and Human Services had a page on its website for how citizens should respond to infected family members.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[40]:394,452
And hey, what about pushing Phalanx right through the FDA?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[41]
But Phalanx didn’t work.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[42]:0,75
Yeah, and do you know how long it would have taken to invent one that did?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[42]:75,148
Look how much time and money had been put into cancer research, or AIDS.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[42]:148,320
Do you want to be the man who tells the American people that he’s diverting funds from either one of those for some new disease that most people haven’t even heard of?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[42]:320,432
Look at what we’ve put into research during and after the war, and we still don’t have a cure or a vaccine.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[42]:432,492
We knew Phalanx was a placebo, and we were grateful for it.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[42]:492,536
It calmed people down and let us do our job.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[43]:0,54
What, you would have rather we told people the truth?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[43]:54,149
That it wasn’t a new strain of rabies but a mysterious uber-plague that reanimated the dead?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[43]:149,269
Can you imagine the panic that would have happened: the protest, the riots, the billions in damage to private property?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[43]:269,478
Can you imagine all those wet-pants senators who would have brought the government to a standstill so they could railroad some high-profile and ultimately useless “Zombie Protection Act” through Congress?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[43]:478,570
Can you imagine the damage it would have done to that administration’s political capital?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[43]:570,641
We’re talking about an election year, and a damn hard, uphill fight.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[43]:641,839
We were the “cleanup crew,” the unlucky bastards who had to mop up all the shit left by the last administration, and believe me, the previous eight years had piled up one tall mountain of shit!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[43]:839,1038
The only reason we squeaked back into power was because our new propped-up patsy kept promising a “return to peace and prosperity.” The American people wouldn’t have settled for anything less.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[43]:1038,1206
They thought they’d been through some pretty tough times already, and it would have been political suicide to tell them that the toughest ones were actually up ahead.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[44]
So you never really tried to solve the problem.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[45]:0,13
Oh, c’mon.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[45]:13,47
Can you ever “solve” poverty?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[45]:47,79
Can you ever “solve” crime?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[45]:79,162
Can you ever “solve” disease, unemployment, war, or any other societal herpes?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[45]:162,171
Hell no.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[45]:171,270
All you can hope for is to make them manageable enough to allow people to get on with their lives.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[45]:270,312
That’s not cynicism, that’s maturity.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[45]:312,339
You can’t stop the rain.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[45]:339,469
All you can do is just build a roof that you hope won’t leak, or at least won’t leak on the people who are gonna vote for you.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[46]
What does that mean?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[47]
C’mon…
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[48]:0,11
Seriously.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[48]:11,31
What does that mean?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[49]:0,142
Fine, whatever, “Mister Smith goes to motherfuckin’ Washington,” it means that, in politics, you focus on the needs of your power base.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[49]:142,187
Keep them happy, and they keep you in office.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[50]
Is that why certain outbreaks were neglected?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[51]
Jesus, you make it sound like we just forgot about them.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[52]
Did local law enforcement request additional support from the federal government?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[53]:0,116
When have cops not asked for more men, better gear, more training hours, or “community outreach program funds”?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[53]:116,271
Those pussies are almost as bad as soldiers, always whining about never having “what they need,” but do they have to risk their jobs by raising taxes?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[53]:271,356
Do they have to explain to Suburban Peter why they’re fleecing him for Ghetto Paul?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[54]
You weren’t worried about public disclosure?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[55]
From who?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[56]
The press, the media.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[57]:0,17
The “media”?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[57]:17,191
You mean those networks that are owned by some of the largest corporations in the world, corporations that would have taken a nosedive if another panic hit the stock market?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[57]:191,202
That media?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[58]
So you never actually instigated a cover-up?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[59]:0,52
We didn’t have to; they covered it up themselves.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[59]:52,100
They had as much, or more, to lose than we did.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[59]:100,214
And besides, they’d already gotten their stories the year before when the first cases were reported in America.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[59]:214,272
Then winter came, Phalanx hit the shelves, cases dropped.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[59]:272,412
Maybe they “dissuaded” a few younger crusading reporters, but, in reality, the whole thing was pretty much old news after a few months.

It had become “manageable.” People were learning to live with it and they were already hungry for something different.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[59]:535,617
Big news is big business, and you gotta stay fresh if you want to stay successful.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[60]
But there were alternative media outlets.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[61]:0,43
Oh sure, and you know who listens to them?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[61]:43,111
Pansy, overeducated know-it-alls, and you know who listens to them?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[61]:111,119
Nobody!
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[61]:119,219
Who’s going to care about some PBS-NPR fringe minority that’s out of touch with the mainstream?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[61]:219,331
The more those elitist eggheads shouted “The Dead Are Walking,” the more most real Americans tuned them out.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[62]
So, let me see if I understand your position.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[63]
The administration’s position.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[64]
The administration’s position, which is that you gave this problem the amount of attention that you thought it deserved.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[65]
Right.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[66]
Given that at any time, government always has a lot on its plate, and especially at this time because another public scare was the last thing the American people wanted.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[67]
Yep.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[68]
So you figured that the threat was small enough to be “managed” by both the Alpha teams abroad and some additional law enforcement training at home.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[69]
You got it.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[70]
Even though you’d received warnings to the contrary, that it could never just be woven into the fabric of public life and that it actually was a global catastrophe in the making.

TROY, MONTANA, USA
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[75]:0,233
[This neighborhood is, according to the brochure, the “New Community” for the “New America.” Based on the Israeli “Masada” model, it is clear just from first glance that this neighborhood was built with one goal in mind.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[75]:233,358
The houses all rest on stilts, so high as to afford each a perfect view over the twenty-foot-high, reinforced concrete wall.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[75]:358,476
Each house is accessed by a retractable staircase and can connect to its neighbor by a similarly retractable walkway.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[75]:476,766
The solar cell roofs, the shielded wells, the gardens, lookout towers, and thick, sliding, steel-reinforced gate have all served to make Troy an instant success with its inhabitants, so much so that its developer has already received seven more orders across the continental United States.

Troy’s developer, chief architect, and first mayor is Mary Jo Miller.]
====

====

Oh yeah, I was worried, I was worried about my car payments and Tim’s business loan.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[77]:87,204
I was worried about that widening crack in the pool and the new nonchlorinated filter that still left an algae film.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[77]:204,377
I was worried about our portfolio, even though my e-broker assured me this was just first-time investor jitters and that it was much more profitable than a standard 401(k).
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[77]:377,474
Aiden needed a math tutor, Jenna needed just the right Jamie Lynn Spears cleats for soccer camp.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[77]:474,545
Tim’s parents were thinking of coming to stay with us for Christmas.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[77]:545,575
My brother was back in rehab.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[77]:575,662
Finley had worms, one of the fish had some kind of fungus growing out of its left eye.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[77]:662,698
These were just some of my worries.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[77]:698,737
I had more than enough to keep me busy.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[78]
Did you watch the news?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[79]:0,83
Yeah, for about five minutes every day: local headlines, sports, celebrity gossip.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[79]:83,133
Why would I want to get depressed by watching TV?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[79]:133,193
I could do that just by stepping on the scale every morning.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[80]:0,26
What about other sources?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[80]:26,32
Radio?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[81]:0,20
Morning drive time?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[81]:20,42
That was my Zen hour.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[81]:42,126
After the kids were dropped off, I’d listen to [name withheld for legal reasons].
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[81]:126,166
His jokes helped me get through the day.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[82]
What about the Internet?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[83]:0,15
What about it?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[83]:15,137
For me, it was shopping; for Jenna, it was homework; for Tim, it was…stuff he kept swearing he’d never look at again.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[83]:137,204
The only news I ever saw was what popped up on my AOL welcome page.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[84]
At work, there must have been some discussion…
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[85]:0,19
Oh yeah, at first.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[85]:19,120
It was kinda scary, kinda weird, “you know I hear it’s not really rabies” and stuff like that.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[85]:120,335
But then that first winter things died down, remember, and anyway, it was a lot more fun to rehash last night’s episode of Celebrity Fat Camp or totally bitch out whoever wasn’t in the break room at that moment.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[86]:0,93
One time, around March or April, I came into work and found Mrs. Ruiz clearing out her desk.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[86]:93,196
I thought she was being downsized or maybe outsourced, you know, something I considered a real threat.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[86]:196,431
She explained that it was “them,” that’s how she always referred to it, “them” or “everything that’s happening.” She said that her family’d already sold their house and were buying a cabin up near Fort Yukon, Alaska.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[86]:431,523
I thought that was the stupidest thing I’d ever heard, especially from someone like Inez.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[86]:523,593
She wasn’t one of the ignorant ones, she was a “clean” Mexican.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[86]:593,680
I’m sorry to use that term, but that was how I thought back then, that was who I was.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[87]
Did your husband ever show any concern?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[88]:0,61
No, but the kids did, not verbally, or consciously, I think.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[88]:61,96
Jenna started getting into fights.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[88]:96,155
Aiden wouldn’t go to sleep unless we left the lights on.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[88]:155,180
Little things like that.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[88]:180,321
I don’t think they were exposed to any more information than Tim, or I, but maybe they didn’t have the adult distractions to shut it out.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[89]
How did you and your husband respond?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[90]:0,60
Zoloft and Ritalin SR for Aiden, and Adderall XR for Jenna.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[90]:60,90
It did the trick for a while.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[90]:90,206
The only thing that pissed me off was that our insurance didn’t cover it because the kids were already on Phalanx.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[91]
How long had they been on Phalanx?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[92]:0,27
Since it became available.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[92]:27,149
We were all on Phalanx, “Piece of Phalanx, Peace of Mind.” That was our way of being prepared…and Tim buying a gun.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[92]:149,214
He kept promising to take me to the range to learn how to shoot.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[92]:214,308
“Sunday,” he’d always say, “we’re goin’ this Sunday.” I knew he was full of it.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[92]:308,425
Sundays were reserved for his mistress, that eighteen-footer, twin-engine bitch he seemed to sink all his love into.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[92]:425,449
I didn’t really care.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[92]:449,510
We had our pills, and at least he knew how to use the Glock.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[92]:510,561
It was part of life, like smoke alarms or airbags.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[92]:561,759
Maybe you think about it once in a while, it was always just…“just in case.” And besides, really, there was already so much out there to worry about, every month, it seemed, a new nail-biter.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[92]:759,796
How can you keep track of all of it?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[92]:796,837
How do you know which one is really real?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[93]
How did you know?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:0,25
It had just gotten dark.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:25,42
The game was on.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:42,85
Tim was in the BarcaLounger with a Corona.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:85,144
Aiden was on the floor playing with his Ultimate Soldiers.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:144,182
Jenna was in her room doing homework.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:182,244
I was unloading the Maytag so I didn’t hear Finley barking.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:244,296
Well, maybe I did, but I never gave it any thought.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:296,373
Our house was in the community’s last row, right at the foot of the hills.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:373,446
We lived in a quiet, just developed part of North County near San Diego.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:446,571
There was always a rabbit, sometimes a deer, running across the lawn, so Finley was always throwing some kind of a shit fit.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:571,653
I think I glanced at the Post-it to get him one of those citronella bark collars.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:653,752
I’m not sure when the other dogs started barking, or when I heard the car alarm down the street.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:752,836
It was when I heard something that sounded like a gunshot that I went into the den.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:836,865
Tim hadn’t heard anything.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:865,903
He had the volume jacked up too high.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:903,1035
I kept telling him he had to get his hearing checked, you just don’t spend your twenties in a speed metal band without…[sighs].
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:1035,1062
Aiden’d heard something.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:1062,1087
He asked me what it was.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:1087,1151
I was about to say I didn’t know when I saw his eyes go wide.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:1151,1227
He was looking past me, at the glass sliding door that led to the backyard.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[94]:1227,1267
I turned just in time to see it shatter.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[95]:0,86
It was about five foot ten, slumped, narrow shoulders with this puffy, wagging belly.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[95]:86,170
It wasn’t wearing a shirt and its mottled gray flesh was all torn and pockmarked.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[95]:170,229
It smelled like the beach, like rotten kelp and saltwater.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[95]:229,264
Aiden jumped up and ran behind me.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[95]:264,326
Tim was out of the chair, standing between us and that thing.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[95]:326,381
In a split second, it was like all the lies fell away.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[95]:381,470
Tim looked frantically around the room for a weapon just as it grabbed him by the shirt.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[95]:470,506
They fell on the carpet, wrestling.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[95]:506,570
He shouted for us to get in the bedroom, for me to get the gun.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[95]:570,620
We were in the hallway when I heard Jenna scream.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[95]:620,660
I ran to her room, threw open the door.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[95]:660,799
Another one, big, I’d say six and a half feet with giant shoulders and bulging arms. The window was broken and it had Jenna by the hair.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[95]:799,839
She was screaming “Mommymommymommy!”
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[96]
What did you do?
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[97]:0,28
I…I’m not totally sure.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[97]:28,81
When I try to remember, everything goes by too fast.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[97]:81,103
I had it by the neck.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[97]:103,142
It pulled Jenna toward its open mouth.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[97]:142,306
I squeezed hard…pulled…The kids say I tore the thing’s head off, just ripped it right out with all the flesh and muscle and whatever else hanging in tatters.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[97]:306,341
I don’t think that’s possible.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[97]:341,492
Maybe with all your adrenaline pumping…I think the kids just have built it up in their memories over the years, making me into SheHulk or something.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[97]:492,514
I know I freed Jenna.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[97]:514,625
I remember that, and just a second later, Tim came in the room, with this thick, black goo all over his shirt.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[97]:625,687
He had the gun in one hand and Finley’s leash in the other.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[97]:687,757
He threw me the car keys and told me to get the kids in the Suburban.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[97]:757,811
He ran into the backyard as we headed for the garage.
====
/html/body/div/div[3]/p[97]:811,858
I heard his gun go off as I started the engine.

====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[3]:0,84
It stretched to the horizon: sedans, trucks, buses, RVs, anything that could drive.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[3]:84,122
I saw tractors, I saw a cement mixer.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[3]:122,277
Seriously, I even saw a flatbed with nothing but a giant sign on it, a billboard advertising a “Gentlemen’s Club.” People were sitting on top of it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[3]:277,354
People were riding on top of everything, on roofs, in between luggage racks.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[3]:354,449
It reminded me of some old picture of trains in India with people hanging on them like monkeys.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[4]:0,89
All kinds of crap lined the road—suitcases, boxes, even pieces of expensive furniture.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[4]:89,185
I saw a grand piano, I’m not kidding, just smashed like it was thrown off the top of a truck.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[4]:185,226
There were also a lot of abandoned cars.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[4]:226,297
Some had been pushed over, some were stripped, some looked burned out.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[4]:297,377
I saw a lot of people on foot, walking across the plains or alongside the road.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[4]:377,439
Some were knocking on windows, holding up all kinds of stuff.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[4]:439,477
A few women were exposing themselves.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[4]:477,529
They must have been looking to trade, probably gas.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[4]:529,609
They couldn’t have been looking for rides, they were moving faster than cars.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[4]:609,650
It wouldn’t make sense, but…[shrugs].
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[5]:0,76
Back down the road, about thirty miles, traffic was moving a little better.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[5]:76,116
You’d think the mood would be calmer.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[5]:116,129
It wasn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[5]:129,230
People were flashing their lights, bumping the cars in front of them, getting out and throwing down.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[5]:230,309
I saw a few people lying by the side of the road, barely moving or not at all.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[5]:309,434
People were running past them, carrying stuff, carrying children, or just running, all in the same direction of the traffic.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[5]:434,463
A few miles later, I saw why.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:0,46
Those creatures were swarming among the cars.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:46,148
Drivers on the outer lanes tried to veer off the road, sticking in the mud, trapping the inner lanes.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:148,184
People couldn’t open their doors.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:184,218
The cars were too tightly packed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:218,305
I saw those things reach in open windows, pulling people out or pulling themselves in.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:305,343
A lot of drivers were trapped inside.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:343,394
Their doors were shut and, I’m assuming, locked.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:394,454
Their windows were rolled up, it was safety tempered glass.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:454,517
The dead couldn’t get in, but the living couldn’t get out.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:517,624
I saw a few people panic, try to shoot through their windshields, destroying the only protection they had.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:624,632
Stupid.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:632,719
They might have bought themselves a few hours in there, maybe even a chance to escape.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:719,766
Maybe there was no escape, just a quicker end.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:766,833
There was a horse trailer, hitched to a pickup in the center lane.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:833,872
It was rocking crazily back and forth.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[6]:872,901
The horses were still inside.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[7]:0,132
The swarm continued among the cars, literally eating its way up the stalled lines, all those poor bastards just trying to get away.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[7]:132,207
And that’s what haunts me most about it, they weren’t headed anywhere.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[7]:207,279
This was the I-80, a strip of highway between Lincoln and North Platte.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[7]:279,360
Both places were heavily infested, as well as all those little towns in between.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[7]:360,397
What did they think they were doing?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[7]:397,424
Who organized this exodus?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[7]:424,436
Did anyone?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[7]:436,496
Did people see a line of cars and join them without asking?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[7]:496,708
I tried to imagine what it must have been like, stuck bumper to bumper, crying kids, barking dog, knowing what was coming just a few miles back, and hoping, praying that someone up ahead knows where he’s going.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[8]:0,87

He just lined up at some building, nothing special about it, just a random door.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[8]:168,295
Sure enough, someone got in line behind him, then a couple more, and before you knew it, they were backed up around the block.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[8]:295,331
No one asked what the line was for.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[8]:331,366
They just assumed it was worth it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[8]:366,404
I can’t say if that story was true.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[8]:404,454
Maybe it’s an urban legend, or a cold war myth.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[8]:454,464
Who knows?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[9]
ALANG, INDIA
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[10]:0,93
[I stand on the shore with Ajay Shah, looking out at the rusting wrecks of once-proud ships.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[10]:93,305
Since the government does not possess the funds to remove them and because both time and the elements have made their steel next to useless, they remain silent memorials to the carnage this beach once witnessed.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[11]
They tell me what happened here was not unusual, all around our world where the ocean meets the land, people trying desperately to board whatever floated for a chance of survival at sea.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[12]:0,92
I didn’t know what Alang was, even though I’d lived my entire life in nearby Bhavnagar.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[12]:92,190
I was an office manager, a “zippy,” white-collar professional from the day I left university.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[12]:190,326
The only time I’d ever worked with my hands was to punch a keyboard, and not even that since all our software went voice recognition.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[12]:326,411
I knew Alang was a shipyard, that’s why I tried to make for it in the first place.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[12]:411,510
I’d expected to find a construction site cranking out hull after hull to carry us all to safety.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[12]:510,555
I had no idea that it was just the opposite.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[12]:555,599
Alang didn’t build ships, it killed them.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[12]:599,662
Before the war, it was the largest breakers yard in the world.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[12]:662,823
Vessels from all nations were bought by Indian scrap-iron companies, run up on this beach, stripped, cut, and disassembled until not the smallest bolt remained.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[12]:823,935
The several dozen vessels I saw were not fully loaded, fully functional ships, but naked hulks lining up to die.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[13]:0,38
There were no dry docks, no slipways.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[13]:38,94
Alang was not so much a yard as a long stretch of sand.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[13]:94,189
Standard procedure was to ram the ships up onto the shore, stranding them like beached whales.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[13]:189,370
I thought my only hope was the half dozen new arrivals that still remained anchored offshore, the ones with skeleton crews and, I hoped, a little bit of fuel left in their bunkers.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[13]:370,470
One of these ships, the Veronique Delmas, was trying to pull one of her beached sisters out to sea.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[13]:470,609
Ropes and chains were haphazardly lashed to the stern of the APL Tulip, a Singapore container ship that had already been partially gutted.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[13]:609,660
I arrived just as the Delmas fired up her engines.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[13]:660,732
I could see the white water churning as she strained against the lines.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[13]:732,789
I could hear some of the weaker ropes snap like gunshots.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[14]:0,65
The stronger chains though…they held out longer than the hull.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[14]:65,120
Beaching the Tulip must have badly fractured her keel.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[14]:120,212
When the Delmas began to pull, I heard this horrible groan, this creaking screech of metal.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[14]:212,311
The Tulip literally split in two, the bow remaining on shore while the stern was pulled out to sea.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[15]:0,169
There was nothing anyone could do, the Delmas was already at flank speed, dragging the Tulip’s stern out into deep water where it rolled over and sank within seconds.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[15]:169,296
There must have been at least a thousand people aboard, packing every cabin and passageway and square inch of open deck space.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[15]:296,352
Their cries were muffled by the thunder of escaping air.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[16]
Why didn’t the refugees just wait aboard the beached ships, pull up the ladders, make them inaccessible?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[17]:0,35
You speak with rational hindsight.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[17]:35,67
You weren’t there that night.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[17]:67,166
The yard was crammed right up to the shoreline, this mad dash of humanity backlit by inland fires.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[17]:166,213
Hundreds were trying to swim out to the ships.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[17]:213,265
The surf was choked with those who didn’t make it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[18]:0,88
Dozens of little boats were going back and forth, shuttling people from shore to ships.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[18]:88,186
“Give me your money,” some of them would say, “everything you have, then I’ll take you.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[19]
Money was still worth something?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[20]:0,54
Money, or food, or anything they considered valuable.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[20]:54,115
I saw one ship’s crew that only wanted women, young women.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[20]:115,174
I saw another that would only take light-skinned refugees.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[20]:174,271
The bastards were shining their torches in people’s faces, trying to root out darkies like me.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[20]:271,437
I even saw one captain, standing on the deck of his ship’s launch, waving a gun and shouting “No scheduled castes, we won’t take untouchables!” Untouchables?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[20]:437,445
Castes?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[20]:445,482
Who the hell still thinks like that?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[20]:482,559
And this is the crazy part, some older people actually got out of the queue!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[20]:559,580
Can you believe that?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[21]:0,76
I’m just highlighting the most extreme negative examples, you understand.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[21]:76,197
For every one profiteer, or repulsive psychopath, there were ten good and decent people whose karma was still untainted.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[21]:197,356
A lot of fishermen and small boat owners who could have simply escaped with their families chose to put themselves in danger by continuing to return to shore.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[21]:356,525
When you think about what they were risking: being murdered for their boats, or just marooned on the beach, or else attacked from beneath by so many underwater ghouls…
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[22]:0,24
There were quite a few.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[22]:24,119
Many infected refugees had tried to swim for the ships and then reanimated after they drowned.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[22]:119,235
It was low tide, just deep enough for a man to drown, but shallow enough for a standing ghoul to reach up for prey.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[22]:235,346
You saw many swimmers suddenly vanish below the surface, or boats capsize with their passengers dragged under.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[22]:346,449
And still rescuers continued to return to shore, or even jumped from ships to save people in the water.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[23]:0,26
That was how I was saved.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[23]:26,64
I was one of those who tried to swim.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[23]:64,118
The ships looked much closer than they actually were.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[23]:118,275
I was a strong swimmer, but after walking from Bhavnagar, after fighting for my life for most of that day, I barely had enough strength to float on my back.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[23]:275,376
By the time I reached my intended salvation, there wasn’t enough air in my lungs to call for help.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[23]:376,398
There was no gangway.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[23]:398,431
The smooth side towered over me.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[23]:431,500
I banged on the steel, shouting up with the last bit of breath I had.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[24]:0,81
Just as I slipped below the surface, I felt a powerful arm wrap around my chest.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[24]:81,164
This is it, I thought; any second, I thought I would feel teeth dig into my flesh.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[24]:164,234
Instead of pulling me down, the arm hauled me back up to the surface.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[24]:234,313
I ended up aboard the Sir Wilfred Grenfell, an ex-Canadian Coast Guard cutter.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[24]:313,439
I tried to talk, to apologize for not having any money, to explain that I could work for my passage, do anything they needed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[24]:439,464
The crewman just smiled.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[24]:464,585
“Hold on,” he said to me, “we’re about to get under way.” I could feel the deck vibrate then lurch as we moved.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[25]:0,61
That was the worst part, watching the other ships we passed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[25]:61,123
Some of the onboard infected refugees had begun to reanimate.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[25]:123,197
Some vessels were floating slaughterhouses, others just burned at anchor.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[25]:197,231
People were leaping into the sea.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[25]:231,282
Many who sank beneath the surface never reappeared.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[26]
TOPEKA, KANSAS, USA
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[27]:0,154
[Sharon could be considered beautiful by almost any standard—with long red hair, sparkling green eyes, and the body of a dancer or a prewar supermodel.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[27]:154,200
She also has the mind of a four-year-old girl.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[28]:0,62
We are at the Rothman Rehabilitation Home for Feral Children.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[28]:62,230
Doctor Roberta Kelner, Sharon’s caseworker, describes her condition as “lucky.” “At least she has language skills, a cohesive thought process,” she explains.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[28]:230,394
“It’s rudimentary, but at least it’s fully functional.” Doctor Kelner is eager for the interview, but Doctor Sommers, Rothman’s program director, is not.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[28]:394,517
Funding has always been spotty for this program, and the present administration is threatening to close it down altogether.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[29]:0,24
Sharon is shy at first.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[29]:24,81
She will not shake my hand and seldom makes eye contact.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[29]:81,196
Although Sharon was found in the ruins of Wichita, there is no way of knowing where her story originally occurred.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[30]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[31]:0,33
We were in church, Mommy and me.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[31]:33,75
Daddy told us that he would come find us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[31]:75,105
Daddy had to go do something.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[31]:105,138
We had to wait for him in church.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:0,21
Everybody was there.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:21,41
They all had stuff.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:41,141
They had cereal, and water, and juice, and sleeping bags and flashlights and…[she mimes a rifle].
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:141,164
Mrs. Randolph had one.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:164,190
She wasn’t supposed to.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:190,211
They were dangerous.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:211,244
She told me they were dangerous.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:244,270
She was Ashley’s mommy.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:270,292
Ashley was my friend.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:292,322
I asked her where was Ashley.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:322,342
She started to cry.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:342,427
Mommy told me not to ask her about Ashley and told Mrs. Randolph that she was sorry.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:427,488
Mrs. Randolph was dirty, she had red and brown on her dress.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:488,501
She was fat.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[32]:501,524
She had big, soft arms.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[33]:0,55
There were other kids, Jill and Abbie, and other kids.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[33]:55,86
Mrs. McGraw was watching them.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[33]:86,104
They had crayons.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[33]:104,136
They were coloring on the wall.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[33]:136,172
Mommy told me to go play with them.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[33]:172,197
She told me it was okay.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[33]:197,234
She said Pastor Dan said it was okay.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[34]:0,66
Pastor Dan was there, he was trying to make people listen to him.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[34]:66,254
“Please everyone…” [she mimics a deep, low voice] “please stay calm, the ‘thorties’ are coming, just stay calm and wait for the ‘thorties.’” No one was listening to him.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[34]:254,296
Everyone was talking, nobody was sitting.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[34]:296,439
People were trying to talk on their things [mimes holding a cell phone], they were angry at their things, throwing them, and saying bad words.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[34]:439,466
I felt bad for Pastor Dan.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[34]:466,510
[She mimics the sound of a siren.] Outside.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[34]:510,597
[She does it again, starting soft, then growing, then fading out again multiple times.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[35]:0,53
Mommy was talking to Mrs. Cormode and other mommies.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[35]:53,73
They were fighting.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[35]:73,96
Mommy was getting mad.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[35]:96,159
Mrs. Cormode kept saying [in an angry drawl], “Well what if?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[35]:159,212
What else can you do?” Mommy was shaking her head.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[35]:212,253
Mrs. Cormode was talking with her hands.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[35]:253,283
I didn’t like Mrs. Cormode.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[35]:283,312
She was Pastor Dan’s wife.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[35]:312,335
She was bossy and mean.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[36]:0,69
Somebody yelled…“Here they come!” Mommy came and picked me up.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[36]:69,118
They took our bench and put it next to the door.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[36]:118,161
They put all the benches next to the door.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[36]:161,374
“Quick!” “Jam the door!” [She mimics several different voices.] “I need a hammer!” “Nails!” “They’re in the parking lot!” “They’re coming this way!” [She turns to Doctor Kelner.] Can I?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[37]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[38]:0,30
[Doctor Sommers looks unsure.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[38]:30,61
Doctor Kelner smiles and nods.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[38]:61,122
I later learn that the room is soundproofed for this reason.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[39]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[40]:0,37
[Sharon mimics the moan of a zombie.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[40]:37,93
It is undoubtedly the most realistic I have ever heard.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[40]:93,149
Clearly, by their discomfort, Sommers and Kelner agree.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[41]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[42]:0,18
They were coming.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[42]:18,36
They came bigger.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[42]:36,54
[Again she moans.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[42]:54,136
Then follows up by pounding her right fist on the table.] They wanted to come in.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[42]:136,191
[Her blows are powerful, mechanical.] People screamed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[42]:191,214
Mommy hugged me tight.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[42]:214,322
“It’s okay.” [Her voice softens as she begins to stroke her own hair.] “I won’t let them get you.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[42]:322,334
Shhhh….”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[43]:0,144
[Now she bangs both fists on the table, her strikes becoming more chaotic as if to simulate multiple ghouls.] “Brace the door!” “Hold it!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[43]:144,265
Hold it!” [She simulates the sound of shattering glass.] The windows broke, the windows in the front next to the door.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[43]:265,287
The lights got black.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[43]:287,309
Grown-ups got scared.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[43]:309,323
They screamed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:0,56
[Her voice returns to her mother’s.] “Shhhh…baby.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:56,169
I won’t let them get you.” [Her hands go from her hair to her face, gently stroking her forehead and cheeks.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:169,209
Sharon gives Kelner a questioning look.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:209,222
Kelner nods.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:222,381
Sharon’s voice suddenly simulates the sound of something large breaking, a deep phlegm-filled rumble from the bottom of her throat.] “They’re coming in!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:381,610
Shoot ’em, shoot ’em!” [She makes the sound of gunfire then…] “I won’t let them get you, I won’t let them get you.” [Sharon suddenly looks away, over my shoulder to something that isn’t there.] “The children!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:610,671
Don’t let them get the children!” That was Mrs. Cormode.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:671,693
“Save the children!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:693,744
Save the children!” [Sharon makes more gunshots.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:744,864
She balls her hands into a large double fist, bringing it down hard on an invisible form.] Now the kids started crying.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:864,941
[She simulates stabbing, punching, striking with objects.] Abbie cried hard.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:941,969
Mrs. Cormode picked her up.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:969,1075
[She mimes lifting something, or someone, up and swinging them against the wall.] And then Abbie stopped.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:1075,1321
[She goes back to stroking her own face, her mother’s voice has become harder.] “Shhh…it’s okay, baby, it’s okay…” [Her hands move down from her face to her throat, tightening into a strangling grip.] “I won’t let them get you.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[44]:1321,1351
I WON’T LET THEM GET YOU!”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[45]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[46]
[Sharon begins to gasp for air.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[47]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[48]:0,42
[Doctor Sommers makes a move to stop her.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[48]:42,72
Doctor Kelner puts up a hand.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[48]:72,145
Sharon suddenly ceases, throwing her arms out to the sound of a gunshot.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[49]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[50]:0,51
Warm and wet, salty in my mouth, stinging my eyes.

Arms picked me up and carried me.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[50]:85,188
[She gets up from the table, mimicking a motion close to a football.] Carried me into the parking lot.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[50]:188,333
“Run, Sharon, don’t stop!” [This is a different voice now, not her mother’s.] “Just run, run-run-run!” They pulled her away from me.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[50]:333,353
Her arms let me go.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[50]:353,378
They were big, soft arms.

KHUZHIR, OLKHON ISLAND, LAKE BAIKAL, THE HOLY RUSSIAN EMPIRE
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[52]:0,117
[The room is bare except for a table, two chairs, and a large wall mirror, which is almost sure to be one-way glass.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[52]:117,246
I sit across from my subject, writing on the pad provided for me (my transcriber has been forbidden for “security reasons”).
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[52]:246,394
Maria Zhuganova’s face is worn, her hair is graying, her body strains the seams of the fraying uniform she insists on wearing for this interview.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[52]:394,486
Technically we are alone, although I sense watching eyes behind the room’s one-way glass.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[53]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[54]:0,47
We didn’t know that there was a Great Panic.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[54]:47,76
We were completely isolated.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[54]:76,229
About a month before it began, about the same time as that American newswoman broke the story, our camp was placed on indefinite communication blackout.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[54]:229,327
All the televisions were removed from the barracks, all the personal radios and cell phones, too.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[54]:327,396
I had one of those cheap disposable types with five prepaid minutes.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[54]:396,432
It was all my parents could afford.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[54]:432,519
I was supposed to use it to call them on my birthday, my first birthday away from home.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[55]:0,80
We were stationed in North Ossetia, Alania, one of our wild southern republics.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[55]:80,190
Our official duty was “peacekeeping,” preventing ethnic strife between the Ossetia and Ingush minorities.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[55]:190,262
Our rotation was up about the same time they cut us off from the world.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[55]:262,310
A matter of “state security” they called it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[56]
Who were “they”?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[57]:0,125
Everyone: our officers, the Military Police, even a plain-clothed civilian who just seemed to appear one day out of nowhere.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[57]:125,178
He was a mean little bastard, with a thin, rat face.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[57]:178,222
That’s what we called him: “Rat Face.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[58]
Did you ever try to find out who he was?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[59]:0,21
What, me personally?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[59]:21,28
Never.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[59]:28,53
Neither did anyone else.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[59]:53,91
Oh, we griped; soldiers always gripe.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[59]:91,148
But there also wasn’t time for any serious complaints.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[59]:148,231
Right after the blackout was put into effect, we were placed on full combat alert.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[59]:231,338
Up until then it had been easy duty—lazy, monotonous, and broken only by the occasional mountain stroll.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[59]:338,421
Now we were in those mountains for days at a time with full battle dress and ammo.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[59]:421,460
We were in every village, every house.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[59]:460,551
We questioned every peasant and traveler and…I don’t know…goat that crossed our path.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[60]:0,17
Questioned them?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[60]:17,26
For what?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[61]:0,17
I didn’t know.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[61]:17,192
“Is everyone in your family present?” “Has anyone gone missing?” “Has anyone been attacked by a rabid animal or man?” That was the part that confused me the most.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[61]:192,199
Rabid?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[61]:199,238
I understood the animal part, but man?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[61]:238,421
There were a lot of physical inspections, too, stripping these people to their bare skin while the medics searched every inch of their bodies for…something…we weren’t told what.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[62]:0,37
It didn’t make sense, nothing did.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[62]:37,185
We once found a whole cache of weapons, 74s, a few older 47s, plenty of ammo, probably bought from some corrupt opportunist right in our battalion.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[62]:185,377
We didn’t know who the weapons belonged to; drug runners, or the local gangsters, maybe even those supposed “Reprisal Squads” that were the reason for our deployment in the first place.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[62]:377,397
And what did we do?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[62]:397,413
We left it all.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[62]:413,509
That little civilian, “Rat Face,” he had a private meeting with some of the village elders.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[62]:509,640
I don’t know what was discussed, but I can tell you that they looked scared half to death: crossing themselves, praying silently.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:0,24
We didn’t understand.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:24,49
We were confused, angry.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:49,111
We didn’t understand what the hell we were doing out there.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:111,164
We had this one old veteran in our platoon, Baburin.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:164,216
He’d fought in Afghanistan and twice in Chechnya.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:216,311
It was rumored that during Yeltsin’s crackdown, his BMP 1 was the first to fire on the Duma.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:311,353
We used to like to listen to his stories.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:353,439
He was always good-natured, always drunk…when he thought he could get away with it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:439,487
He changed after the incident with the weapons.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:487,535
He stopped smiling, there were no more stories.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:535,683
I don’t think he ever touched a drop after that, and when he spoke to you, which was rare, the only thing he ever said was, “This isn’t good.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:683,790
Something’s going to happen.” Whenever I tried to ask him about it, he would just shrug and walk away.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:790,824
Morale was pretty low after that.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:824,855
People were tense, suspicious.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[63]:855,960
Rat Face was always there, in the shadows, listening, watching, whispering into the ears of our officers.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:0,120
He was with us the day we swept a little no-name town, this primitive hamlet at what looked like the edge of the world.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:120,178
We’d executed our standard searches and interrogations.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:178,212
We were just about to pack it in.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:212,291
Suddenly this child, this little girl came running down the only road in town.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:291,328
She was crying, obviously terrified.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:328,456
She was chattering to her parents…I wish I could have taken the time to learn their language…and pointing across the field.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:456,539
There was a tiny figure, another little girl, staggering across the mud toward us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:539,620
Lieutenant Tikhonov raised his binoculars and I watched his face lose its color.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:620,739
Rat Face came up next to him, gave a look through his own glasses, then whispered something in the lieutenant’s ear.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:739,838
Petrenko, platoon sharpshooter, was ordered to raise his weapon and center the girl in his sights.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:838,846
He did.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:846,931
“Do you have her?” “I have her.” “Shoot.” That’s how it went, I think.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:931,961
I remember there was a pause.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:961,1033
Petrenko looked up at the lieutenant and asked him to repeat the order.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:1033,1070
“You heard me,” he said angrily.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:1070,1129
I was farther away than Petrenko and even I’d heard him.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:1129,1215
“I said eliminate the target, now!” I could see the tip of his rifle was shaking.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:1215,1343
He was a skinny little runt, not the bravest or the strongest, but suddenly he lowered his weapon and said he wouldn’t do it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:1343,1359
Just like that.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:1359,1413
“No, sir.” It felt like the sun froze in the sky.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:1413,1469
No one knew what to do, especially Lieutenant Tikhonov.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[64]:1469,1548
Everyone was looking at one another, then we were all looking out at the field.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[65]:0,57
Rat Face was walking out there, slowly, almost casually.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[65]:57,120
The little girl was now close enough so we could see her face.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[65]:120,160
Her eyes were wide, locked on Rat Face.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[65]:160,241
Her arms were raised, and I could just make out this high-pitched, rasping moan.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[65]:241,278
He met her halfway across the field.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[65]:278,336
It was over before most of us realized what had happened.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[65]:336,491
In one smooth motion, Rat Face pulled a pistol from underneath his coat, shot her right between the eyes, then turned around and sauntered back toward us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[65]:491,557
A woman, probably the little girl’s mother, exploded into sobs.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[65]:557,608
She fell to her knees, spitting and cursing at us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[65]:608,655
Rat Face didn’t seem to care or even notice.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[65]:655,768
He just whispered something to Lieutenant Tikhonov, then remounted the BMP as if he was hailing a Moscow taxicab.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[66]:0,83
That night…lying awake in my bunk, I tried not to think about what had happened.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[66]:83,208
I tried not to think about the fact that the MPs had taken Petrenko away, or that our weapons had been locked in the armory.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[66]:208,371
I knew I should have felt bad for the child, angry, even vengeful toward Rat Face, and maybe even a little bit guilty because I didn’t lift a finger to stop it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[66]:371,491
I knew those were the kinds of emotions I should have been feeling; at that point the only thing I could feel was fear.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[66]:491,576
I kept thinking about what Baburin had said, that something bad was going to happen.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[66]:576,618
I just wanted to go home, see my parents.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[66]:618,673
What if there’d been some horrible terrorist attack?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[66]:673,695
What if it was a war?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[66]:695,764
My family lived in Bikin, almost within sight of the Chinese border.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[66]:764,820
I needed to speak to them, to make sure they were okay.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[66]:820,918
I worried so much that I started throwing up, so much so that they checked me into the infirmary.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[66]:918,1042
That’s why I missed the patrol that day, that’s why I was still on bed rest when they came back the following afternoon.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[67]:0,60
I was in my bunk, rereading an outdated copy of Semnadstat.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[67]:60,108
2 I heard a commotion, vehicle engines, voices.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[67]:108,160
A crowd was already assembled on the parade ground.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[67]:160,234
I pushed my way through and saw Arkady standing in the center of the mob.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[67]:234,306
Arkady was the heavy machine gunner from my squad, a big bear of a man.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[67]:306,397
We were friends because he kept the other men away from me, if you understand what I mean.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[67]:397,435
He said I reminded him of his sister.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[67]:435,463
[Smiles sadly.] I liked him.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[68]:0,40
There was someone crawling at his feet.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[68]:40,154
It looked like an old woman, but there was a burlap hood over her head and a chain leash wrapped around her neck.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[68]:154,226
Her dress was torn and the skin of her legs had been scraped clean off.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[68]:226,267
There was no blood, just this black pus.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[68]:267,310
Arkady was well into a loud, angry speech.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[68]:310,327
“No more lies!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[68]:327,371
No more orders to shoot civilians on sight!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[68]:371,424
And that’s why I put the little zhopoliz down…”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[69]:0,68
I looked for Lieutenant Tikhonov but I couldn’t see him anywhere.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[69]:68,102
I got a ball of ice in my stomach.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[70]:0,110
“…because I wanted you all to see!” Arkady lifted the chain, pulling the old babushka up by her throat.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[70]:110,149
He grabbed the hood and ripped it off.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[70]:149,226
Her face was gray, just like the rest of her, her eyes were wide and fierce.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[70]:226,276
She snarled like a wolf and tried to grab Arkady.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[70]:276,354
He wrapped one powerful hand around her throat, holding her at arm’s length.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:0,121
“I want you all to see why we are here!” He grabbed the knife from his belt and plunged it into the woman’s heart.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:121,143
I gasped, we all did.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:143,211
It was buried up to the hilt and she continued to squirm and growl.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:211,271
“You see!” he shouted, stabbing her several more times.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:271,283
“You see!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:283,322
This is what they’re not telling us!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:322,440
This is what they have us breaking our backs to find!” You could see heads start to nod, a few grunts of agreement.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:440,498
Arkady continued, “What if these things are everywhere?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:498,625
What if they’re back home, with our families right now!” He was trying to make eye contact with as many of us as possible.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:625,679
He wasn’t paying enough attention to the old woman.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:679,739
His grip loosened, she pulled free and bit him on the hand.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:739,754
Arkady roared.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:754,796
His fist caved in the old woman’s face.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:796,856
She fell to his feet, writhing and gurgling that black goo.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:856,891
He finished the job with his boot.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[71]:891,920
We all heard her skull crack.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:0,55
Blood was trickling down the gouge in Arkady’s fist.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:55,130
He shook it at the sky, screaming as the veins in his neck began to bulge.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:130,169
“We want to go home!” he bellowed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:169,249
“We want to protect our families!” Others in the crowd began to pick it up.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:249,257
“Yes!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:257,290
We want to protect our families!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:290,314
This is a free country!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:314,335
This is a democracy!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:335,414
You can’t keep us in prison!” I was shouting, too, chanting with the rest.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:414,525
That old woman, the creature that could take a knife in the heart without dying…what if they were back home?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:525,584
What if they were threatening our loved ones…my parents?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:584,666
All the fear, all the doubt, every tangled, negative emotion all fused into rage.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:666,689
“We want to go home!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:689,805
We want to go home!” Chanting, chanting, and then…A round cracked past my ear and Arkady’s left eye imploded.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:805,859
I don’t remember running, or inhaling the tear gas.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[72]:859,1085
I don’t remember when the Spetznaz commandos appeared, but suddenly they were all around us, beating us down, shackling us together, one of them stepping on my chest so hard I thought I was going to die right then and there.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[73]
Was that the Decimation?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[74]:0,28
No, that was the beginning.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[74]:28,71
We weren’t the first army unit to rebel.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[74]:71,146
It had actually started about the time the MPs first closed down the base.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[74]:146,251
About the time we staged our little “demonstration,” the government had decided how to restore order.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[75]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[76]
[She straightens her uniform, composes herself before speaking.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[77]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[78]
To “decimate”…I used to think it meant just to wipe out, cause horrible damage, destroy…it actually means to kill by a percentage of ten, one out of every ten must die…and that’s exactly what they did to us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[79]:0,79
The Spetznaz had us assemble on the parade ground, full dress uniform no less.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[79]:79,286
Our new commanding officer gave a speech about duty and responsibility, about our sworn oath to protect the motherland, and how we had betrayed that oath with our selfish treachery and individual cowardice.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[79]:286,328
I’d never heard words like that before.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[79]:328,417
“Duty?” “Responsibility?” Russia, my Russia, was nothing but an apolitical mess.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[79]:417,495
We lived in chaos and corruption, we were just trying to get through the day.
====

Even the army was no bastion of patriotism; it was a place to learn a trade, get food and a bed, and maybe even a little money to send home when the government decided it was convenient to pay its soldiers.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[79]:702,784
“Oath to protect the motherland?” Those weren’t the words of my generation.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[79]:784,1066
That was what you’d hear from old Great Patriotic War veterans, the kind of broken, demented geezers who used to besiege Red Square with their tattered Soviet banners and their rows and rows of medals pinned to their faded, moth-eaten uniforms. Duty to the motherland was a joke.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[79]:1066,1091
But I wasn’t laughing.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[79]:1091,1126
I knew the executions were coming.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[79]:1126,1248
The armed men surrounding us, the men in the guard towers, I was ready, every muscle in my body was tensing for the shot.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[79]:1248,1279
And then I heard those words…
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[80]:0,62
“You spoiled children think democracy is a God-given right.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[80]:62,92
You expect it, you demand it!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[80]:92,154
Well, now you’re going to get your chance to practice it.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[81]
His exact words, stamped behind my eyelids for the rest of my life.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[82]
What did he mean?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[83]:0,54
We would be the ones to decide who would be punished.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[83]:54,151
Broken up into groups of ten, we would have to vote on which one of us was going to be executed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[83]:151,234
And then we…the soldiers, we would be the ones to personally murder our friends.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[83]:234,278
They rolled these little pushcarts past us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[83]:278,318
I can still hear their creaking wheels.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[83]:318,390
They were full of stones, about the size of your hand, sharp and heavy.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[83]:390,445
Some cried out, pleaded with us, begged like children.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[83]:445,572
Some, like Baburin, simply knelt there silently, on this knees, staring right into my face as I brought the rock down into his.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[84]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[85]
[She sighs softly, glancing over her shoulder at the one-way glass.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[86]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[87]:0,12
Brilliance.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[87]:12,38
Sheer fucking brilliance.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[87]:38,237
Conventional executions might have reinforced discipline, might have restored order from the top down, but by making us all accomplices, they held us together not just by fear, but by guilt as well.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[87]:237,321
We could have said no, could have refused and been shot ourselves, but we didn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[87]:321,350
We went right along with it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[87]:350,494
We all made a conscious choice and because that choice carried such a high price, I don’t think anyone ever wanted to make another one again.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[87]:494,574
We relinquished our freedom that day, and we were more than happy to see it go.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[87]:574,691
From that moment on we lived in true freedom, the freedom to point to someone else and say “They told me to do it!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[87]:691,791
It’s their fault, not mine.” The freedom, God help us, to say “I was only following orders.”
====

BRIDGETOWN, BARBADOS, WEST INDIES FEDERATION
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[89]:0,230
[Trevor’s Bar personifies the “Wild West Indies,” or, more specifically, each island’s “Special Economic Zone.” This is not a place most people would associate with the order and tranquility of postwar Caribbean life.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[89]:230,253
It is not meant to be.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[89]:253,459
Fenced off from the rest of the island and catering to a culture of chaotic violence and debauchery, the Special Economic Zones are engineered specifically to separate “off-islanders” from their money.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[89]:459,492
My discomfort seems to please T.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[89]:492,506
Sean Collins.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[89]:506,633
The giant Texan slides a shot of “kill-devil” rum in my direction, then swings his massive, boot-clad feet onto the table.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[90]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[91]:0,58
They haven’t come up with a name for what I used to do.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[91]:58,83
Not a real one, not yet.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[91]:83,177
“Independent contractor” sounds like I should be layin’ drywall and smearin’ plaster.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[91]:177,237
“Private security” sounds like some dumbass mall guard.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[91]:237,356
“Mercenary” is the closest, I guess, but at the same time, about as far from the real me as you could have gotten.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[91]:356,526
A mercenary sounds like some crazed-out ’Nam vet, all tats and handlestache, humpin’ in some Third World cesspool ’cause he can’t hack it back in the real world.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[91]:526,551
That wasn’t me at all.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[91]:551,843
Yeah, I was a vet, and yeah, I used my training for cash…funny thing about the army, they always promise to teach you “marketable skills,” but they never mention that, by far, there’s nothing more marketable than knowing how to kill some people while keeping others from being killed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[92]:0,66
Maybe I was a mercenary, but you’d never know it to look at me.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[92]:66,149
I was clean-cut, nice car, nice house, even a housekeeper who came in once a week.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[92]:149,262
I had plenty of friends, marriage prospects, and my handicap at the country club was almost as good as the pros.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[92]:262,347
Most importantly, I worked for a company no different from any other before the war.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[92]:347,416
There was no cloak and dagger, no back rooms and midnight envelopes.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[92]:416,492
I had vacation days and sick days, full medical and a sweet dental package.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[92]:492,539
I paid my taxes, too much; I paid into my IRA.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[92]:539,751
I could have worked overseas; Lord knows there was plenty of demand, but after seeing what my buddies went through in the last brushfire, I said, screw it, let me guard some fat CEO or worthless, dumb celebrity.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[92]:751,804
And that’s where I found myself when the Panic hit.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[93]:0,57
You don’t mind if I don’t mention any names, ’kay?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[93]:57,189
Some of these people are still alive, or their estates are still active, and…can you believe, they’re still threatening to sue.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[93]:189,219
After all that’s gone down?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[93]:219,345
Okay, so I can’t name names or places, but figure it’s an island…a big island…a long island, right next to Manhattan.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[93]:345,376
Can’t sue me for that, right?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[94]:0,46
My client, I’m not sure what he really did.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[94]:46,91
Something in entertainment, or high finance.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[94]:91,101
Beats me.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[94]:101,176
I think he might have even been one of the senior shareholders in my firm.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[94]:176,239
Whatever, he had bucks, lived in this amazing pad by the beach.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[95]:0,55
Our client liked to know people who were known by all.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[95]:55,188
His plan was to provide safety for those who could raise his image during and after the war, playing Moses to the scared and famous.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[95]:188,225
And you know what, they fell for it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[95]:225,489
The actors, and singers, and rappers and pro athletes, and just the professional faces, like the ones you see on talk shows or reality shows, or even that little rich, spoiled, tired-looking whore who was famous for just being a rich, spoiled, tired-looking whore.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[96]:0,70
There was that record mogul guy with the big ’ole diamond earrings.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[96]:70,122
He had this tricked-out AK with a grenade launcher.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[96]:122,199
He loved to talk about how it was an exact replica of the one from Scarface.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[96]:199,280
I didn’t have the heart to tell him that Señor Montana had used a sixteen A-1.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[97]:0,69
There was the political comedy guy, you know, the one with the show.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[97]:69,341
He was snorting blow between the air bags of this teeny Thai stripper while spewing about how what was happening wasn’t just about the living versus the dead, it would send shock waves through every facet of our society: social, economic, political, even environmental.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[97]:341,510
He said that, subconsciously, everyone already knew the truth during the “Great Denial,” and that’s why they wigged out so hard when the story was finally broken.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[97]:510,632
It all actually kinda made sense, until he started spewing about high fructose corn syrup and the feminization of America.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[98]:0,80
Crazy, I know, but you kinda expected those people to be there, at least I did.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[98]:80,288
What I didn’t expect was all their “people.” Every one of them, no matter who they were or what they did, had to have, at least, I don’t know how many stylists and publicists and personal assistants.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[98]:288,406
Some of them, I think, were pretty cool, just doing it for the money, or because they figured they’d be safe there.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[98]:406,448
Young people just trying to get a leg up.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[98]:448,477
Can’t fault them for that.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[98]:477,558
Some of the others though…real pricks all high on the smell of their own piss.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[98]:558,613
Just rude and pushy and ordering everyone else around.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[98]:613,787
One guy sticks out in my mind, only because he wore this baseball cap that read “Get It Done!” I think he was the chief handler of the fat fuck who won that talent show.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[98]:787,838
That guy must have had fourteen people around him!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[98]:838,1019
I remember thinking at first that it would be impossible to take care of all these people, but after my initial tour of the premises, I realized our boss had planned for everything.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[99]:0,62
He’d transformed his home into a survivalists’ wet dream.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[99]:62,215
He had enough dehydrated food to keep an army fed for years, as well as an endless supply of water from a desalinizer that ran right out into the ocean.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[99]:215,329
He had wind turbines, solar panels, and backup generators with giant fuel tanks buried right under the courtyard.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[99]:329,455
He had enough security measures to hold off the living dead forever: high walls, motion sensors, and weapons, oh the weapons.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[99]:455,648
Yeah, our boss had really done his homework, but what he was most proud of was the fact that every room in the house was wired for a simultaneous webcast that went out all over the world 24/7.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[99]:648,735
This was the real reason for having all his “closest” and “best” friends over.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[99]:735,845
He didn’t just want to ride out the storm in comfort and luxury, he wanted everyone to know he’d done it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[99]:845,917
That was the celebrity angle, his way of ensuring high-profile exposure.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[100]:0,129
Not only did you have a webcam in almost every room, but there was all the usual press you’d find on the Oscar’s red carpet.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[100]:129,201
I honestly never knew how big an industry entertainment journalism was.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[100]:201,277
There had to be dozens of them there from all these magazines and TV shows.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[100]:277,324
“How are you feeling?” I heard that a lot.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[100]:324,462
“How are you holding up?” “What do you think is going to happen?” and I swear I even heard someone ask “What are you wearing?”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[101]:0,167
For me, the most surreal moment was standing in the kitchen with some of the staff and other bodyguards, all of us watching the news that was showing, guess what, us!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[101]:167,304
The cameras were literally in the other room, pointed at some of the “stars” as they sat on the couch watching another news channel.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[101]:304,624
The feed was live from New York’s Upper East Side; the dead were coming right up Third Avenue, people were taking them on hand to hand, hammers and pipes, the manager of a Modell’s Sporting Goods was handing out all his baseball bats and shouting “Get ’em in the head!” There was this one guy on rollerblades.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[101]:624,706
He had a hockey stick in his hand, a big ’ole meat cleaver bolted to the blade.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[101]:706,784
He was doing an easy thirty, at that speed he might have taken a neck or two.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[101]:784,1021
The camera saw the whole thing, the rotted arm that shot out of the sewer drain right in front of him, the poor guy back flipping into the air, coming down hard on his face, then being dragged, screaming, by his ponytail into the drain.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[101]:1021,1124
At that moment the camera in our living room swung back to catch the reactions of the watching celebs.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[101]:1124,1174
There were a few gasps, some honest, some staged.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[101]:1174,1381
I remember thinking I had less respect for the ones who tried to fake some tears than I did for the little spoiled whore who called the rollerblading guy a “dumbass.” Hey, at least she was being honest.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[101]:1381,1479
I remember I was standing next to this guy, Sergei, a miserable, sad-faced, hulking motherfucker.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[101]:1479,1586
His stories about growing up in Russia convinced me that not all Third World cesspools had to be tropical.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[101]:1586,1709
It was when the camera was catching the reactions of the beautiful people that he mumbled something to himself in Russian.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[101]:1709,1835
The only word I could make out was “Romanovs” and I was about to ask him what he meant when we all heard the alarm go off.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[102]:0,90
Something had triggered the pressure sensors we’d placed several miles around the wall.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[102]:90,171
They were sensitive enough to detect just one zombie, now they were going crazy.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[102]:171,355
Our radios were squawking: “Contact, contact, southwest corner…shit, there’s hundreds of them!” It was a damn big house, it took me a few minutes to get to my firing position.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[102]:355,409
I didn’t understand why the lookout was so nervous.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[102]:409,449
So what if there were a couple hundred.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[102]:449,483
They’d never get over the wall.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[102]:483,528
Then I heard him shout “They’re running!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[102]:528,602
Holy fuckin’ shit, they’re fast!” Fast zombies, that turned my gut.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[102]:602,728
If they could run, they could climb, if they could climb, maybe they could think, and if they could think…now I was scared.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[102]:728,893
I remember our boss’s friends were all raiding the armory, racing around like extras in an ’80s action flick by the time I made the third-floor guestroom window.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[103]:0,72
I flipped the safety off my weapon and flipped the guards off my sight.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[103]:72,159
It was one of the newest Gen’s, a fusion of light amplification and thermal imaging.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[103]:159,225
I didn’t need the second part because Gs gave off no body heat.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[103]:225,325
So when I saw the searing, bright green signatures of several hundred runners, my throat tightened.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[103]:325,353
Those weren’t living dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[104]:0,39
“There it is!” I heard them shout.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[104]:39,119
“That’s the house on the news!” They were carrying ladders, guns, babies.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[104]:119,186
A couple of them had these heavy satchels strapped to their backs.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[104]:186,288
They were booking it for the front gate, big tough steel that was supposed to stop a thousand ghouls.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[104]:288,394
The explosion tore them right off their hinges, sent them flipping into the house like giant ninja stars.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[104]:394,445
“Fire!” the boss was screaming into the radio.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[104]:445,466
“Knock ’em down!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[104]:466,478
Kill ’em!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[104]:478,497
Shootshootshoot!”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[105]:0,74
The “attackers,” for lack of a better label, stampeded for the house.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[105]:74,194
The courtyard was full of parked vehicles, sports cars and Hummers, and even a monster truck belonging to some NFL cat.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[105]:194,350
Freakin fireballs, all of them, blowing over on their sides or just burning in place, this thick oily smoke from their tires blinding and choking everyone.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[105]:350,439
All you could hear was gunfire, ours and theirs, and not just our private security team.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[105]:439,581
Any big shot who wasn’t crapping his pants either had it in his head to be a hero, or felt he had to protect his rep in front of his peeps.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[105]:581,639
A lot of them demanded that their entourage protect them.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[105]:639,738
Some did, these poor twenty-year-old personal assistants who’d never fired a gun in their lives.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[105]:738,768
They didn’t last very long.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[105]:768,840
But then there were also the peons who turned and joined the attackers.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[105]:840,1071
I saw this one real queeny hairdresser stab an actress in the mouth with a letter opener, and, ironically, I watched Mister “Get It Done” try to wrestle a grenade away from the talent show guy before it went off in their hands.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[106]:0,88
It was bedlam, exactly what you thought the end of the world was supposed to look like.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[106]:88,198
Part of the house was burning, blood everywhere, bodies or bits of them spewed over all that expensive stuff.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[106]:198,269
I met the whore’s rat dog as we were both heading for the back door.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[106]:269,303
He looked at me, I looked at him.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[106]:303,535
If it’d been a conversation, it probably woulda gone like, “What about your master?” “What about yours?” “Fuck ’em.” That was the attitude among a lot of the hired guns, the reason I hadn’t fired a shot all night.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[106]:535,664
We’d been paid to protect rich people from zombies, not against other not-so-rich people who just wanted a safe place to hide.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[106]:664,736
You could hear them shouting as they charged in through the front door.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[106]:736,861
Not “grab the booze” or “rape the bitches”; it was “put out the fire!” and “get the women and kids upstairs!”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[107]:0,71
I stepped over Mister Political Comedy Guy on my way out to the beach.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[107]:71,258
He and this chick, this leathery old blonde who I thought was supposed to be his political enemy, were goin’ at it like there was no tomorrow, and, hey, maybe for them, there wasn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[107]:258,405
I made it out to the sand, found a surfboard, probably worth more than the house I grew up in, and started paddling for the lights on the horizon.

Not just my boss, but all of those pampered parasites.

They had the means to stay way outta harm’s way, so why didn’t they use it; go to Antarctica or Greenland or just stay where they were but stay the hell outta the public eye?

But then again, maybe they couldn’t, like a switch you just can’t turn off.

Everyone knew it, everyone expected it, and that is exactly why it didn’t happen.

Because the danger was so omnipresent, all the machinery had been put in place over the years to avoid it.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[119]:371,587
The hotline between the two capitals was in place, ambassadors were on a first-name basis, and generals, politicians, and everyone involved in the process was trained to make sure the day they all feared never came.

The infection hadn’t hit us as hard as some other countries.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[120]:63,94
Our land was very mountainous.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[120]:94,124
Transportation was difficult.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[120]:124,360
Our population was relatively small; given the size of our country and when you consider that many of our cities could be easily isolated by a proportionately large military, it is not difficult to see how optimistic our leadership was.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[121]:0,68
The problem was refugees, millions of them from the east, millions!

Streaming across Baluchistan, throwing our plans into disarray.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[121]:132,211
So many areas were already infected, great swarms slouching toward our cities.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[121]:211,293
Our border guards were overwhelmed, entire outposts buried under waves of ghouls.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[121]:293,379
There was no way to close the border and at the same time deal with our own outbreaks.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[122]:0,61
We demanded that the Pakistanis get control of their people.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[122]:61,109

The majority of refugees came from India, just passing through Pakistan in an attempt to reach someplace safe.

Those in Islamabad were quite willing to let them go.

Pakistan’s south central mountains: the Pab, the Kirthar, the Central Brahui range.

We could have stopped any number of refugees, or living dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[123]:557,579
Our plan was refused.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[123]:579,722
Some paranoid military attaché at their embassy told us outright that any foreign troops on their soil would be seen as a declaration of war.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[123]:722,820
I don’t know if their president ever saw our proposal; our leaders never spoke to him directly.

You see what I mean about India and Pakistan.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[123]:866,903
We didn’t have their relationship.

But what could we do?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[124]:22,138
Every day hundreds of thousands of people crossed our border, and of those perhaps tens of thousands were infected!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[124]:138,170
We had to take decisive action.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[124]:170,198
We had to protect ourselves!

To cut it at just one place, the Ketch River Bridge, would have effectively sealed off 60 percent of all refugee traffic.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[125]:509,540
The area was heavily infested.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[125]:540,628
I targeted the bridge’s center foundation, which would be the hardest part to repair.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[125]:628,657
The bombs separated cleanly.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[125]:657,733
They were high-explosive, conventional ordnance, just enough to do the job.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[125]:733,875
American aircraft, from when we used to be your allies of convenience, used to destroy a bridge built with American aid for the same purpose.

The irony was not lost on the high command.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[125]:919,956
Personally, I could have cared less.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[125]:956,1123
As soon as I felt my Phantom lighten, I hit my burners, waited for my observer plane’s report, and prayed with all my might that the Pakistanis wouldn’t retaliate.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[126]:0,38
Of course my prayers went unanswered.

Three hours later their garrison at Qila Safed shot up our border station.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[126]:312,372
Their embassy in Tehran had destroyed its codes and radios.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[126]:372,504
That sonofabitching colonel had shot himself rather than betray any “state secrets.” We had no hotline, no diplomatic channels.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[126]:504,562
We didn’t know how to contact the Pakistani leadership.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[126]:562,618
We didn’t even know if there was any leadership left.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[126]:618,698
It was such a mess, confusion turning to anger, anger turning on our neighbors.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[126]:698,733
Every hour the conflict escalated.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[126]:733,762
Border clashes, air strikes.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[126]:762,884

For God’s sake, they helped us build our nuclear program from the ground up!

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[131]:127,329
They supplied the materials, the technology, the third party brokering with North Korea and Russian renegades…we wouldn’t have been a nuclear power if it wasn’t for our fraternal Muslim brothers.

All the smoke, the crap that’d been filling the air all summer.

I sure as hell hadn’t, and now it’s up there with, like, Pearl Harbor…no, not Pearl…that was a surprise attack.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[135]:455,583
This was more like Little Bighorn, where we…well…at least the people in charge, they knew what was up, or they should have.

The point is, it wasn’t a surprise, the war…or emergency, or whatever you want to call it…it was already on.

It had been, what, three months since everyone jumped on the panic train.

You remember what it was like, people just freaking out…boarding up their houses, stealing food, guns, shooting everything that moved.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[136]:137,358
They probably killed more people, the Rambos and the runaway fires, and the traffic accidents and just the…the whole shit storm that we now call “the Great Panic”; I think that killed more people at first than Zack.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[137]:0,100
I guess I can see why the powers that be thought that one big stand-up battle was such a good idea.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[137]:100,236
They wanted to show the people that they were still in charge, get them to calm the hell down so they could deal with the real problem.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[137]:236,316
I get it, and because they needed a propaganda smackdown, I ended up in Yonkers.

Right down on the ground, right behind sandbags or in fighting holes.

We wasted so much time, so much energy preparing these elaborate firing positions.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[143]:181,229
Good “cover and concealment,” they told us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[143]:229,252
Cover and concealment?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[143]:252,371
“Cover” means physical protection, conventional protection, from small arms and artillery or air-dropped ordnance.

At least those might have been useful.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[146]:163,340
We had Avenger Humvee mounted Stinger surface-to-air missile sets, we had this AVLB portable bridge layer system, perfect for the three-inch-deep creek that ran by the freeway.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[146]:340,554
We had a bunch of XM5 electronic warfare vehicles all crammed with radar and jamming gear and…and…oh yeah, and we even had a whole FOL, Family of Latrines, just plopped right there in the middle of everything.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[150]:147,272
They were cool and comfortable in their BDUs while we sweated under layers of rubber, charcoal, and thick, heavy body armor.

And what genius thought to put us in body armor anyway?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[150]:328,398

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[150]:521,602
And then you’ve got the Net Rigs…the Land Warrior combat integration system.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[150]:602,741
It was this whole personal electronics suite that allowed each one of us to link up with each other and the higher-ups to link up with us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[150]:741,825
Through your eyepiece you could download maps, GPS data, real-time satellite recon.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[150]:825,1054
You could find your exact position on a battlefield, your buddies’ positions, the bad guys…you could actually look through the video camera on your weapon, or anyone else’s, to see what’s over a hedge or around a corner.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[150]:1054,1206
Land Warrior allowed every soldier to have the information of an entire command post, and let the command post control those soldiers as a single unit.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[150]:1206,1298
“Netrocentric,” that’s what I kept hearing from the officers in front of the cameras.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[150]:1298,1578
“Netrocentric” and “hyperwar.” Cool terms, but they didn’t mean shit when you’re trying to dig a fighting hole with MOPP gear and body armor, and Land Warrior and standard combat load, and all of it on the hottest day in what was one of the hottest summers on record.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[150]:1578,1644
I can’t believe I was still standing when Zack began to show up.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[151]:0,118
It was just a trickle at first, ones and twos staggering between the abandoned cars that jammed the deserted freeway.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[151]:118,160
At least the refugees had been evacuated.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[151]:160,205
Okay, that was another thing they did right.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[151]:205,266
Picking a choke point and clearing the civilians, great job.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[151]:266,284
Everything else…
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[152]:0,76
Zack started entering the first kill zone, the one designated for the MLRS.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[152]:76,180
I didn’t hear the rockets launch, my hood muffled the noise, but I saw them streak toward the target.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[152]:180,301
I saw them arch on their way down, as their casings broke away to reveal all those little bomblets on plastic streamers.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[152]:301,394
They’re about the size of a hand grenade, antipersonnel with a limited antiarmor capacity.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[152]:394,480
They scattered amongst the Gs, detonating once they hit the road or an abandoned car.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[152]:480,705
Their gas tanks went up in like little volcanoes, geysers of fire and debris that added to the “steel rain.” I got to be honest, it was a rush, dudes were cheering in their mikes, me too, watching ghouls start to tumble.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[152]:705,827
I’d say there were maybe thirty, maybe forty or fifty, zombies spread out all across this half mile stretch of freeway.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[152]:827,892
The opening bombardment took out at least three-quarters of them.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[153]
Only three-quarters.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[154]:0,54
[Todd finishes his cigarette in one long, angry drag.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[154]:54,91
Immediately, he reaches for another.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[155]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[156]:0,71
Yep, and that’s what should have made us worry right then and there.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[156]:71,460
“Steel rain” hit each and every single one of them, shredded their insides; organs and flesh were scattered all over the damn place, dropping from their bodies as they came toward us…but head shots…you’re trying to destroy the brain, not the body, and as long as they got a working thinker and some mobility…some were still walking, others too thrashed to stand were crawling.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[156]:460,514
Yeah, we should have worried, but there wasn’t time.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[157]:0,43
The trickle was now turning into a stream.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[157]:43,94
More Gs, dozens now, thick among the burning cars.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[157]:94,180
Funny thing about Zack…you always think he’s gonna be dressed in his Sunday best.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[157]:180,344
That’s how the media portrayed them, right, especially in the beginning…Gs in business suits and dresses, like, a cross section of everyday America, only dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[157]:344,387
That’s not what they looked like at all.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[157]:387,523
Most infected, the early infected, the ones who went in that first wave, they either died under treatment or at home in their own beds.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[157]:523,587
Most were either in hospital gowns, or pajamas and nightshirts.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[157]:587,676
Some were in sweats or their undies…or just naked, a lot of them completely buck bare.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[157]:676,802
You could see their wounds, the dried marks on their bodies, the gouges that made you shiver even inside that sweltering gear.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[158]:0,204
The second “steel rain” didn’t have half the impact of the first, no more gas tanks to catch, and now the more tightly packed Gs just happened to be shielding each other from a possible head wound.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[158]:204,232
I wasn’t scared, not yet.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[158]:232,334
Maybe my wood was gone, but I was pretty sure it’d be back when Zack entered the Army’s kill zone.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[159]:0,111
Again, I couldn’t hear the Paladins, too far back up the hill, but I sure heard, and saw, their shells land.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[159]:111,189
These were standard HE 155s, a high explosive core with a fragmentation case.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[159]:189,232
They did even less damage than the rockets!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[160]
Why is that?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[161]:0,27
No balloon effect for one.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[161]:27,144
When a bomb goes off close to you, it causes the liquid in your body to burst, literally, like a freakin’ balloon.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[161]:144,271
That doesn’t happen with Zack, maybe because he carries less bodily fluid than us or because that fluid’s more like a gel.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[161]:271,287
I don’t know.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[161]:287,339
But it didn’t do shit, neither did the SNT effect.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[162]
What is SNT?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[163]:0,56
Sudden Nerve Trauma, I think that’s what you call it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[163]:56,107
It’s another effect of close-in high explosives.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[163]:107,235
The trauma is so great sometimes that your organs, your brain, all of it, just shuts down like God flickin’ your life switch.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[163]:235,288
Something to do with electrical impulses or whatnot.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[163]:288,333
I don’t know, I’m not a fuckin’ doctor.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[164]
But that didn’t happen.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[165]:0,10
Not once!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[165]:10,107
I mean…don’t get me wrong…it’s not like Zack just skipped through the barrage unscathed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[165]:107,368
We saw bodies blown to shit, tossed into the air, ripped to pieces, even complete heads, live heads with eyes and jaws still moving, popping sky high like freakin’ Cristal corks…we were taking them down, no doubt, but not as many or as fast as we needed to!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[166]
The stream was now like a river, a flood of bodies, slouching, moaning, stepping over their mangled bros as they rolled slowly and steadily toward us like a slow-motion wave.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[167]:0,133
The next kill zone was direct fire from the heavy arms, the tank’s main 120s and Bradleys with their chain guns and FOTT missiles.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[167]:133,259
The Humvees also began to open up, mortars and missiles and the Mark-19s, which are, like, machine guns, but firing grenades.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[167]:259,378
The Comanches came whining in at what felt like inches above our heads with chains and Hellfires and Hydra rocket pods.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[168]
It was a fuckin’ meat grinder, a wood chipper, organic matter clouding like sawdust above the horde.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[169]
Nothing can survive this, I was thinking, and for a little while, it looked like I was right…until the fire started to die.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[170]
Started to die?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[171]
Petering out, withering…
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[172]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[173]
[For a second he is silent, and then, angrily, his eyes refocus.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[174]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:0,33
No one thought about it, no one!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:33,105
Don’t pull my pud with stories about budget cuts and supply problems!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:105,162
The only thing in short supply was common fucking sense!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:162,561
Not one of those West Point, War College, medals-up-the-ass, four-star fart bags said, “Hey, we got plenty of fancy weapons, we got enough shit for them to shoot!?!” No one thought about how many rounds the artillery would need for sustained operations, how many rockets for the MLRS, how many canister shots…the tanks had these things called canister shots…basically a giant shotgun shell.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:561,709
They fired these little tungsten balls…not perfect you know, wasting like a hundred balls for every G, but fuck, dude, at least it was something!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:709,744
Each Abrams only had three, three!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:744,783
Three out of a total loadout of forty!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:783,821
The rest were standard HEAT or SABOT!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:821,948
Do you know what a “Silver Bullet,” an armor-piercing, depleted-uranium dart is going to do to a group of walking corpses?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:948,957
Nothing!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:957,1072
Do you know what it feels like to see a sixty-something-ton tank fire into a crowd with absolutely ass-all result!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:1072,1095
Three canister rounds!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:1095,1122
And what about flechettes?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:1122,1262
That’s the weapon we always hear about these days, flechettes, these little steel spikes that turn any weapon into an instant scattergun.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:1262,1358
We talk about them like they’re a new invention, but we had them as far back as, like, Korea.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:1358,1410
We had them for the Hydra rockets and the Mark-19s.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:1410,1535
Just imagine that, just one 19 firing three hundred and fifty rounds a minute, each round holding, like, a hundred 2 spikes!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[175]:1535,1594
Maybe it wouldn’t have turned the tide…but…Goddammit!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[176]
The fire was dying, Zack was still coming…and the fear…everyone was feeling it, in the orders from the squad leaders, in the actions of the men around me…That little voice in the back of your head that just keeps squeaking “Oh shit, oh shit.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[177]:0,78
We were the last line of defense, the afterthought when it came to firepower.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[177]:78,197
We were supposed to pick off the random lucky G who happened to slip through the giant bitchslap of our heavier stuff.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[177]:197,301
Maybe one in three of us was expected to fire his weapon, one in every ten was expected to score a kill.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[178]
They came by the thousands, spilling out over the freeway guardrails, down the side streets, around the houses, through them…so many of them, their moans so loud they echoed right through our hoods.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[179]:0,268
We flipped our safeties off, sighted our targets, the order came to fire…I was a SAW 3 gunner, a light machine gun that you’re supposed to fire in short, controlled bursts about as long as it takes to say “Die motherfucker die.” The initial burst was too low.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[179]:268,302
I caught one square in the chest.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[179]:302,404
I watched him fly backward, hit the asphalt, then get right back up again as if nothing had happened.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[179]:404,435
Dude…when they get back up…
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[180]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[181]:0,47
[The cigarette has burned down to his fingers.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[181]:47,89
He drops and crushes it without noticing.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[182]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[183]:0,52
I did my best to control my fire, and my sphincter.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[183]:52,103
“Just go for the head,” I kept telling myself.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[183]:103,215
“Keep it together, just go for the head.” And all the time my SAW’s chattering “Die motherfucker die.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[184]:0,96
We could have stopped them, we should have, one guy with a rifle, that’s all you need, right?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[184]:96,166
Professional soldiers, trained marksmen…how could they get through?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[184]:166,237
They still ask that, critics and armchair Pattons who weren’t there.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[184]:237,267
You think it’s that simple?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[184]:267,416
You think that after being “trained” to aim for the center mass your whole military career you can suddenly make an expert head shot every time?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[184]:416,522
You think in that straitjacket and suffocation hood it’s easy to recharge a clip or clear a weapon jam?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[184]:522,881
You think that after watching all the wonders of modern warfare fall flat on their high-tech hyper ass, that after already living through three months of the Great Panic and watching everything you knew as reality be eaten alive by an enemy that wasn’t even supposed to exist that you’re gonna keep a cool fucking head and a steady fucking trigger finger?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[185]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[186]
[He stabs that finger at me.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[187]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[188]:0,14
Well, we did!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[188]:14,89
We still managed to do our job and make Zack pay for every fuckin’ inch!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[188]:89,186
Maybe if we’d had more men, more ammo, maybe if we’d just been allowed to focus on our job…
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[189]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[190]
[His finger curls back into his fist.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[191]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:0,87
Land Warrior, high-tech, high-priced, high-profile netro-fucking-centric Land Warrior.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:87,209
To see what was in front of our face was bad enough, but spybird uplinks were also showing how truly large the horde was.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:209,270
We might be facing thousands, but behind them were millions!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:270,341
Remember, we were taking on the bulk of New York City’s infestation!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:341,451
This was only the head of one really long undead snake stretching all the way back to Times Fuckin’ Square!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:451,481
We didn’t need to see that.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:481,511
I didn’t need to know that!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:511,564
That little scared voice wasn’t so little anymore.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:564,633
“Oh shit, OH SHIT!” And suddenly it wasn’t in my head anymore.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:633,656
It was in my earpiece.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:656,758
Every time some jerkoff couldn’t control his mouth, Land Warrior made sure the rest of us heard it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:758,944
“There’s too many!” “We gotta get the fuck outta here!” Someone from another platoon, I didn’t know his name, started hollering “I hit him in the head and he didn’t die!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:944,1180
They don’t die when you shoot them in the head!” I’m sure he must have missed the brain, it can happen, a round just grazing the inside of the skull…maybe if he’d been calm and used his own brain, he would have realized that.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:1180,1297
Panic’s even more infectious than the Z Germ and the wonders of Land Warrior allowed that germ to become airborne.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:1297,1399
“What?” “They don’t die?” “Who said that?” “You shot it in the head?” “Holy crap!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[192]:1399,1511
They’re indestructible!” All over the net you could hear this, browning shorts across the info superhighway.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[193]:0,43
“Everyone pipe down!” someone shouted.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[193]:43,61
“Hold the line!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[193]:61,295
Stay off the net!” an older voice, you could tell, but suddenly it was drowned out in this scream and suddenly my eyepiece, and I’m sure everyone else’s, was filled with the sight of blood spurting into a mouth of broken teeth.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[193]:295,361
The sight was from a dude in the yard of a house behind the line.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[193]:361,451
The owners must have left a few reanimated family members locked in when they bugged out.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[193]:451,581
Maybe the shock from the explosions weakened the door or something, because they came bursting out, right into this poor bastard.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[193]:581,655
His gun camera recorded the whole thing, fell right at the perfect angle.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[193]:655,830
There were five of them, a man, a woman, three kids, they had him pinned on his back, the man was on his chest, the kids had him by the arms, trying to bite through his suit.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[193]:830,897
The woman tore his mask off, you could see the terror in his face.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[193]:897,967
I’ll never forget his shriek as she bit off his chin and lower lip.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[193]:967,1016
“They’re behind us!” someone was shouting.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[193]:1016,1055
“They’re coming out of the houses!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[193]:1055,1076
The line’s broken!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[193]:1076,1315
They’re everywhere!” Suddenly the image went dark, cut off from an external source, and the voice, the older voice, was back again…“Stay off the net!” he ordered, trying real hard to control his voice and then the link went dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[194]:0,229
I’m sure it must have taken more than a few seconds, it had to, even if they’d been hovering above our heads, but, it seemed like right after the communications line blacked out that the sky was suddenly screaming with JSFs.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[194]:229,275
4 I didn’t see them release their ordnance.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[194]:275,373
I was at the bottom of my hole cursing the army and God, and my own hands for not digging deeper.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[194]:373,411
That ground shook, the sky went dark.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[194]:411,491
Debris was everywhere, earth and ash and burning whatever flying above my head.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[194]:491,559
I felt this weight slam between my shoulder blades, soft and heavy.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[194]:559,661
I rolled over, it was a head and torso, all charred black and still smoking and still trying to bite!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[194]:661,749
I kicked it away and scrambled out of my hole seconds after the last of the JSOW 5 fell.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[195]:0,80
I found myself staring into this cloud of black smoke where the horde had been.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[195]:80,152
The freeway, the houses, everything was covered by this midnight cloud.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[195]:152,290
I vaguely remember other guys getting out of their holes, hatches opening on tanks and Bradleys, everyone just staring into the darkness.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[195]:290,356
There was a quiet, a stillness that, in my mind, lasted for hours.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[196]:0,87
And then they came, right out of the smoke like a freakin’ little kid’s nightmare!

Some were steaming, some were even still burning…some were walking, some crawling, some just dragging themselves along on their torn bellies…maybe one in twenty was still able to move, which left…shit…a couple thousand?

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[196]:315,452
And behind them, mixing with their ranks and pushing steadily toward us, the remaining million that the air strike hadn’t even touched!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[197]:0,38
And that was when the line collapsed.

I don’t remember it all at once.

I see these flashes: people running, grunts, reporters.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[197]:129,427
I remember a newsman with a big Yosemite Sam mustache trying to pull a Beretta from his vest before three burning Gs pulled him down…I remember a dude forcing open the door of a news van, jumping in, throwing out a pretty blond reporter, and trying to drive away before a tank crushed them both.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[197]:427,503
Two news choppers crashed together, showering us with their own steel rain.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[197]:503,603
One Comanche driver…brave, beautiful motherfucker…tried to turn his rotor into the oncoming Gs.

The blade diced a path right down their mass before catching on a car and hurling him into the A&P.

Shooting…crazy random shooting…I took a round in the sternum, in my armor’s center plate.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[197]:799,873
I felt like I’d run into a wall, even though I’d been standing still.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[197]:873,988
It knocked me on my ass, I couldn’t breathe, and just then some dumbass lobbed a flash bang right in front of me.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[198]:0,43
The world was white, my ears were ringing.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[198]:43,151
I froze…hands were clawing me, grabbing my arms. I kicked and punched, I felt my crotch get warm and wet.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[198]:151,195
I shouted but couldn’t hear my own voice.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[198]:195,251
More hands, stronger, were trying to haul me somewhere.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[198]:251,328
Kicking, squirming, cursing, crying…suddenly a fist clocked me in the jaw.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[198]:328,382
It didn’t knock me out, but I was suddenly relaxed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[198]:382,405
These were my buddies.

I know “professional” historians like to talk about how Yonkers represented a “catastrophic failure of the modern military apparatus,” how it proved the old adage that armies perfect the art of fighting the last war just in time for the next one.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[202]:255,309
Personally, I think that’s a big ’ole sack of it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[202]:309,523
Sure, we were unprepared, our tools, our training, everything I just talked about, all one class-A, gold-standard clusterfuck, but the weapon that really failed wasn’t something that rolled off an assembly line.

It’s fear, dude, just fear and you don’t have to be Sun freakin Tzu to know that real fighting isn’t about killing or even hurting the other guy, it’s about scaring him enough to call it a day.

Break their spirit, that’s what every successful army goes for, from tribal face paint to the “blitzkrieg” to…what did we call the first round of Gulf War Two, “Shock and Awe”?

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[202]:972,1007
Perfect name, “Shock and Awe”!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[202]:1007,1058
But what if the enemy can’t be shocked and awed?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[202]:1058,1102
Not just won’t, but biologically can’t!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[202]:1102,1218
That’s what happened that day outside New York City, that’s the failure that almost lost us the whole damn war.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[202]:1218,1348
The fact that we couldn’t shock and awe Zack boomeranged right back in our faces and actually allowed Zack to shock and awe us!

No matter what we do, no matter how many we kill, they will never, ever be afraid!

I bet my ballsack you’ll never get the full story.

You’ll hear about heat and pressure, the fireball that continues expanding, exploding, and literally crushing and burning everything in its path.

Heat and pressure, that’s what thermobaric means.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[205]:378,406
Sounds nasty enough, right?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[205]:406,522
What you won’t hear about is the immediate aftereffect, the vacuum created when that fireball suddenly contracts.

Obviously no one’s going to live long enough to tell that kind of horror story, probably why the Pentagon’s been so good at covering up the truth, but if you ever see a picture of a G, or even an example of a real walking specimen, and he’s got both air bags and windpipe just dangling out from his lips, make sure you give him my number.

====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[210]:0,96
Dispassionate, a rather mundane word to describe one of history’s most controversial figures.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[210]:96,412
Some revere him as a savior, some revile him as a monster, but if you ever met Paul Redeker, ever discussed his views of the world and the problems, or more importantly, the solutions to the problems that plague the world, probably the one word that would always cling to your impression of the man is dispassionate.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[211]:0,132
Paul always believed, well, perhaps not always, but at least in his adult life, that humanity’s one fundamental flaw was emotion.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[211]:132,259
He used to say that the heart should only exist to pump blood to the brain, that anything else was a waste of time and energy.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[211]:259,440
His papers from university, all dealing with alternate “solutions” to historical, societal quandaries, were what first brought him to the attention of the apartheid government.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[211]:440,681
Many psychobiographers have tried to label him a racist, but, in his own words, “racism is a regrettable by-product of irrational emotion.” Others have argued that, in order for a racist to hate one group, he must at least love another.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[211]:681,735
Redeker believed both love and hate to be irrelevant.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[211]:735,915
To him, they were “impediments of the human condition,” and, in his words again, “imagine what could be accomplished if the human race would only shed its humanity.” Evil?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[211]:915,1089
Most would call it that, while others, particularly that small cadre in the center of Pretoria’s power, believed it to be “an invaluable source of liberated intellect.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[212]:0,70
It was the early 1980s, a critical time for the apartheid government.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[212]:70,113
The country was resting on a bed of nails.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[212]:113,343
You had the ANC, you had the Inkatha Freedom Party, you even had extremist, right-wing elements of the Afrikaner population that would have liked nothing better than open revolt in order to bring about a complete racial showdown.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[212]:343,480
On her border, South Africa faced nothing but hostile nations, and, in the case of Angola, a Soviet-backed, Cuban-spearheaded civil war.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[212]:480,687
Add to this mixture a growing isolation from the Western democracies (which included a critical arms embargo) and it was no surprise that a last-ditch fight for survival was never far from Pretoria’s mind.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[213]:0,207
This is why they enlisted the aid of Mister Redeker to revise the government’s ultrasecret “Plan Orange.” “Orange” had been in existence since the apartheid government first came to power in 1948.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[213]:207,352
It was the doomsday scenario for the country’s white minority, the plan to deal with an all-out uprising of its indigenous African population.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[213]:352,438
Over the years it had been updated with the changing strategic outlook of the region.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[213]:438,491
Every decade that situation grew more and more grim.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[213]:491,764
With multiplying independence of her neighbor states, and multiplying voices for freedom from the majority of her own people, those in Pretoria realized that a full-blown confrontation might not just mean the end for the Afrikaner government, but the Afrikaners themselves.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[214]:0,34
This is where Redeker stepped in.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[214]:34,153
His revised Plan Orange, appropriately completed in 1984, was the ultimate survival strategy for the Afrikaner people.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[214]:153,178
No variable was ignored.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[214]:178,500
Population figures, terrain, resources, logistics…Redeker not only updated the plan to include both Cuba’s chemical weapons and his own country’s nuclear option, but also, and this is what made “Orange Eighty-Four” so historic, the determination of which Afrikaners would be saved and which had to be sacrificed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[215]
Sacrificed?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[216]:0,151
Redeker believed that to try to protect everyone would stretch the government’s resources to the breaking point, thus dooming the entire population.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[216]:151,264
He compared it to survivors from a sinking ship capsizing a lifeboat that simply did not have room for them all.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[216]:264,493
Redeker had even gone so far as to calculate who should be “brought aboard.” He included income, IQ, fertility, an entire checklist of “desirable qualities,” including the subject’s location to a potential crisis zone.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[216]:493,658
“The first casualty of the conflict must be our own sentimentality” was the closing statement for his proposal, “for its survival will mean our destruction.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[217]:0,41
Orange Eighty-Four was a brilliant plan.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[217]:41,143
It was clear, logical, efficient, and it made Paul Redeker one of the most hated men in South Africa.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[217]:143,265
His first enemies were some of the more radical, fundamentalist Afrikaners, the racial ideologues and the ultrareligious.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[217]:265,358
Later, after the fall of apartheid, his name began circulating among the general population.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[217]:358,473
Of course he was invited to appear before the “Truth and Reconciliation” hearings, and, of course, he refused.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[217]:473,632
“I won’t pretend to have a heart simply to save my skin,” he stated publicly, adding, “No matter what I do, I’m sure they will come for me anyway.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[218]:0,86
And they did, although it probably was not in the manner Redeker could have expected.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[218]:86,157
It was during our Great Panic, which began several weeks before yours.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[218]:157,272
Redeker was holed up in the Drakensberg cabin he had bought with the accumulated profits of a business consultant.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[218]:272,301
He liked business, you know.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[218]:301,342
“One goal, no soul,” he used to say.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[218]:342,456
He wasn’t surprised when the door blew off its hinges and agents of the National Intelligence Agency rushed in.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[218]:456,513
They confirmed his name, his identity, his past actions.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[218]:513,589
They asked him point-blank if he had been the author of Orange Eighty-Four.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[218]:589,629
He answered without emotion, naturally.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[218]:629,796
He suspected, and accepted, this intrusion as a last-minute revenge killing; the world was going to hell anyway, why not take a few “apartheid devils” down first.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[218]:796,926
What he could have never predicted was the sudden lowering of their firearms, and the removal of the gas masks of the NIA agents.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[218]:926,1126
They were of all colors: black, Asian, colored, and even a white man, a tall Afrikaner who stepped forward, and without giving his name or rank, asked abruptly…“You’ve got a plan for this, man.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[218]:1126,1141
Don’t you?”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[219]:0,78
Redeker had, indeed, been working on his own solution to the undead epidemic.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[219]:78,127
What else could he do in this isolated hideaway?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[219]:127,216
It had been an intellectual exercise; he never believed anyone would be left to read it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[219]:216,377
It had no name, as explained later “because names only exist to distinguish one from others,” and, until that moment, there had been no other plan like his.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[219]:377,562
Once again, Redeker had taken everything into account, not only the strategic situation of the country, but also the physiology, behavior, and “combat doctrine” of the living dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[219]:562,701
While you can research the details of the “Redeker Plan” in any public library around the world, here are some of the fundamental keys:
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[220]:0,49
First of all, there was no way to save everyone.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[220]:49,80
The outbreak was too far gone.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[220]:80,265
The armed forces had already been too badly weakened to effectively isolate the threat, and, spread so thinly throughout the country, they could only grow weaker with each passing day.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[220]:265,453
Our forces had to be consolidated, withdrawn to a special “safe zone,” which, hopefully, would be aided by some natural obstacle such as mountains, rivers, or even an offshore island.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[220]:453,657
Once concentrated within this zone, the armed forces could eradicate the infestation within its borders, then use what resources were available to defend it against further onslaughts of the living dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[220]:657,756
That was the first part of the plan and it made as much sense as any conventional military retreat.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[221]:0,136
The second part of the plan dealt with the evacuation of civilians, and this could not have been envisioned by anyone else but Redeker.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[221]:136,235
In his mind, only a small fraction of the civilian population could be evacuated to the safe zone.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[221]:235,505
These people would be saved not only to provide a labor pool for the eventual wartime economic restoration, but also to preserve the legitimacy and stability of the government, to prove to those already within the zone that their leaders were “looking out for them.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[222]:0,197
There was another reason for this partial evacuation, an eminently logical and insidiously dark reason that, many believe, will forever ensure Redeker the tallest pedestal in the pantheon of hell.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[222]:197,271
Those who were left behind were to be herded into special isolated zones.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[222]:271,383
They were to be “human bait,” distracting the undead from following the retreating army to their safe zone.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[222]:383,566
Redeker argued that these isolated, uninfected refugees must be kept alive, well defended and even resupplied, if possible, so as to keep the undead hordes firmly rooted to the spot.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[222]:566,600
You see the genius, the sickness?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[222]:600,973
Keeping people as prisoners because “every zombie besieging those survivors will be one less zombie throwing itself against our defenses.” That was the moment when the Afrikaner agent looked up at Redeker, crossed himself, and said, “God help you, man.” Another one said, “God help us all.” That was the black one who appeared to be in charge of the operation.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[222]:973,1011
“Now let’s get him out of here.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[223]:0,134
Within minutes they were on a helicopter for Kimberley, the very underground base where Redeker had first written Orange Eighty-Four.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[223]:134,249
He was ushered into a meeting of the president’s surviving cabinet, where his report was read aloud to the room.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[223]:249,335
You should have heard the uproar, with no voice louder than the defense minister’s.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[223]:335,434
He was a Zulu, a ferocious man who’d rather be fighting in the streets than cowering in a bunker.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[224]:0,62
The vice president was more concerned about public relations.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[224]:62,174
He didn’t want to imagine what his backside would be worth if news of this plan ever leaked to the population.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[225]:0,60
The president looked almost personally insulted by Redeker.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[225]:60,206
He physically grabbed the lapels of the safety and security minister and demanded why in hell he brought him this demented apartheid war criminal.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[226]
The minister stammered that he didn’t understand why the president was so upset, especially when it was he who gave the order to find Redeker.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[227]
The president threw his hands in the air and shouted that he never gave such an order, and then, from somewhere in the room, a faint voice said, “I did.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[228]:0,161
He had been sitting against the back wall; now he stood, hunched over by age, and supported by canes, but with a spirit as strong and vital as it had ever been.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[228]:161,381
The elder statesman, the father of our new democracy, the man whose birth name had been Rolihlahla, which some have translated simply into “Troublemaker.” As he stood, all others sat, all others except Paul Redeker.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[228]:381,933
The old man locked eyes on him, smiled with that warm squint so famous the world over, and said, “Molo, mhlobo wam.” “Greetings, person of my region.” He walked slowly over to Paul, turned to the governing body of South Africa, then lifted the pages from the Afrikaner’s hand and said in a suddenly loud and youthful voice, “This plan will save our people.” Then, gesturing to Paul, he said, “This man will save our people.” And then came that moment, the one that historians will probably debate until the subject fades from memory.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[228]:933,966
He embraced the white Afrikaner.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[228]:966,1132
To anyone else this was simply his signature bear hug, but to Paul Redeker…I know that the majority of psychobiographers continue to paint this man without a soul.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[228]:1132,1171
That is the generally accepted notion.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[228]:1171,1223
Paul Redeker: no feelings, no compassion, no heart.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[228]:1223,1422
However, one of our most revered authors, Biko’s old friend and biographer, postulates that Redeker was actually a deeply sensitive man, too sensitive, in fact, for life in apartheid South Africa.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[228]:1422,1581
He insists that Redeker’s lifelong jihad against emotion was the only way to protect his sanity from the hatred and brutality he witnessed on a daily basis.

Not much is known about Redeker’s childhood, whether he even had parents, or was raised by the state, whether he had friends or was ever loved in any way.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[228]:1738,1867
Those who knew him from work were hard-pressed to remember witnessing any social interaction or even any physical act of warmth.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[228]:1867,1960
The embrace by our nation’s father, this genuine emotion piercing his impenetrable shell…

====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[232]:0,37
Perhaps this is all too sentimental.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[232]:37,135
For all we know he was a heartless monster, and the old man’s embrace had absolutely no impact.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[232]:135,211
But I can tell you that that was the last day anyone ever saw Paul Redeker.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[232]:211,263
Even now, no one knows what really happened to him.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[232]:263,375
That is when I stepped in, in those chaotic weeks when the Redeker Plan was implemented throughout the country.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[232]:375,625
It took some convincing to say the least, but once I’d convinced them that I’d worked for many years with Paul Redeker, and, more importantly, I understood his way of thinking better than anyone left alive in South Africa, how could they refuse?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[232]:625,738
I worked on the retreat, then afterward, during the consolidation months, and right up until the end of the war.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[232]:738,846
At least they were appreciative of my services, why else would they grant me such luxurious accommodations?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[232]:846,892
[Smiles.] Paul Redeker, an angel and a devil.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[232]:892,925
Some hate him, some worship him.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[232]:925,946
Me, I just pity him.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[232]:946,1027
If he still exists, somewhere out there, I sincerely hope he’s found his peace.

====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[238]:0,30
Hamburg was heavily infested.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[238]:30,110
They were in the streets, in the buildings, pouring out of the Neuer Elbtunnel.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[238]:110,266
We’d tried to blockade it with civilian vehicles, but they were squirming through any open space like bloated, bloody worms. Refugees were also all over.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[238]:266,343
They’d come from as far away as Saxony, thinking they could escape by sea.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[238]:343,390
The ships were long gone, the port was a mess.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[238]:390,501
We had over a thousand trapped at the Reynolds Aluminiumwerk and at least triple that at the Eurokai terminal.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[238]:501,629
No food, no clean water, just waiting to be rescued with the dead swarming outside, and I don’t know how many infected inside.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[239]:0,72
The harbor was choked with corpses, but corpses that were still moving.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[239]:72,192
We’d blasted them into the harbor with antiriot water cannons; it saved ammo and it helped to keep the streets clear.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[239]:192,253
It was a good idea, until the pressure in the hydrants died.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[239]:253,323
We’d lost our commanding officer two days earlier…freak accident.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[239]:323,387
One of our men had shot a zombie that was almost on top of him.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[239]:387,534
The bullet had gone right through the creature’s head, taking bits of diseased brain tissue out the other end and into the colonel’s shoulder.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[239]:534,546
Insane, eh?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[239]:546,596
He turned over sector command to me before dying.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[239]:596,639
My first official duty was to put him down.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[240]:0,56
I’d set up our command post in the Renaissance Hotel.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[240]:56,172
It was a decent location, good fields of fire with enough space to house our own unit and several hundred refugees.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[240]:172,293
My men, those not involved in holding the barricades, were attempting to perform these conversions on similar buildings.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[240]:293,402
With the roads blocked and trains inoperative, I thought it best to sequester as many civilians as possible.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[240]:402,471
Help would be coming, it was just a question of when it would arrive.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[241]:0,148
I was about to organize a detail to scrounge for converted hand-to-hand weapons, we were running low on ammunition, when the order came to retreat.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[241]:148,170
This was not unusual.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[241]:170,244
Our unit had been steadily withdrawing since the first days of the Panic.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[241]:244,291
What was unusual, though, was the rally point.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[241]:291,372
Division was using map-grid coordinates, the first time since the trouble began.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[241]:372,500
Up until then they had simply used civilian designations on an open channel; this was so refugees could know where to assemble.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[241]:500,591
Now it was a coded transmission from a map we hadn’t used since the end of the cold war.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[241]:591,646
I had to check the coordinates three times to confirm.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[241]:646,710
They put us at Schafstedt, just north of the Nord-Ostsee Kanal.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[241]:710,743
Might as well be fucking Denmark!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[242]:0,60
We were also under strict orders not to move the civilians.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[242]:60,125
Even worse, we were ordered not to inform them of our departure!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[242]:125,155
This didn’t make any sense.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[242]:155,236
They wanted us to pull back to Schleswig-Holstein but leave the refugees behind?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[242]:236,272
They wanted us to just cut and run?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[242]:272,309
There had to be some kind of mistake.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[243]:0,26
I asked for confirmation.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[243]:26,36
I got it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[243]:36,51
I asked again.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[243]:51,122
Maybe they got the map wrong, or had shifted codes without telling us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[243]:122,161
(It wouldn’t be their first mistake.)
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[244]:0,90
I suddenly found myself speaking to General Lang, commander of the entire Northern Front.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[244]:90,113
His voice was shaking.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[244]:113,153
I could hear it even over the shooting.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[244]:153,284
He told me the orders were not a mistake, that I was to rally what was left of the Hamburg Garrison and proceed immediately north.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[244]:284,323
This isn’t happening, I told myself.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[244]:323,334
Funny, eh?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[244]:334,515
I could accept everything else that was happening, the fact that dead bodies were rising to consume the world, but this…following orders that would indirectly cause a mass murder.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:0,55
Now, I am a good soldier, but I am also a West German.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:55,86
You understand the difference?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:86,271
In the East, they were told that they were not responsible for the atrocities of the Second World War, that as good communists, they were just as much victims of Hitler as anyone else.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:271,348
You understand why the skinheads and proto-fascists were mainly in the East?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:348,427
They did not feel the responsibility of the past, not like we did in the West.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:427,503
We were taught since birth to bear the burden of our grandfathers’ shame.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:503,633
We were taught that, even if we wore a uniform, that our first sworn duty was to our conscience, no matter what the consequences.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:633,684
That is how I was raised, that is how I responded.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:684,807
I told Lang that I could not, in good conscience, obey this order, that I could not leave these people without protection.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:807,829
At this, he exploded.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:829,1037
He told me that I would carry out my instructions or I, and, more importantly, my men, would be charged with treason and prosecuted with “Russian efficiency.” And this is what we’ve come to, I thought.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:1037,1135
We’d all heard of what was happening in Russia…the mutinies, the crackdowns, the decimations.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:1135,1251
I looked around at all these boys, eighteen, nineteen years old, all tired and scared and fighting for their lives.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:1251,1281
I couldn’t do that to them.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[245]:1281,1310
I gave the order to withdraw.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[246]
How did they take it?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[247]:0,47
There were no complaints, at least, not to me.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[247]:47,88
They fought a little amongst themselves.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[247]:88,115
I pretended not to notice.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[247]:115,135
They did their duty.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[248]
What about the civilians?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[249]:0,40
[Pause.] We got everything we deserved.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[249]:40,96
“Where are you going?” they shouted from buildings.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[249]:96,145
“Come back, you cowards!” I tried to answer.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[249]:145,192
“No, we’re coming back for you,” I said.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[249]:192,239
“We’re coming back tomorrow with more men.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[249]:239,319
Just stay where you are, we’ll be back tomorrow.” They didn’t believe me.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[249]:319,364
“Fucking liar!” I heard one woman shout.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[249]:364,399
“You’re letting my baby die!”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[250]:0,83
Most of them didn’t try to follow, too worried about the zombies in the streets.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[250]:83,147
A few brave souls grabbed on to our armored personnel carriers.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[250]:147,195
They tried to force their way down the hatches.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[250]:195,216
We knocked them off.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[250]:216,324
We had to button up as the ones trapped in buildings started throwing things, lamps, furniture, down on us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[250]:324,385
One of my men was hit with a bucket filled with human waste.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[250]:385,435
I heard a bullet clang off the hatch of my Marder.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[251]:0,93
On our way out of the city we passed the last of our new Rapid Reaction Stabilization Units.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[251]:93,141
They had been badly mauled earlier in the week.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[251]:141,232
I didn’t know it at the time, but they were one of those units classified as expendable.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[251]:232,334
They were detailed to cover our retreat, to prevent too many zombies, or refugees, from following us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[251]:334,371
They were ordered to hold to the end.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[252]:0,64
Their commander was standing through the cupola of his Leopard.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[252]:64,76
I knew him.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[252]:76,139
We’d served together as part of the NATO’s IFOR in Bosnia.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[252]:139,260
Maybe it is melodramatic to say he saved my life, but he did take a Serbian’s bullet that I’m sure was meant for me.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[252]:260,388
The last time I saw him was in a hospital in Sarajevo, joking about getting out of this madhouse those people called a country.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[252]:388,470
Now here we were, passing on the shattered autobahn in the heart of our homeland.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[252]:470,502
We locked eyes, traded salutes.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[252]:502,599
I ducked back into the APC, and pretended to study my map so the driver wouldn’t see my tears.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[252]:599,684
“When we get back,” I told myself, “I’m going to kill that son of a bitch.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[253]
General Lang.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[254]:0,22
I had it all planned.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[254]:22,80
I would not look angry, not give him any reason to worry.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[254]:80,134
I’d submit my report and apologize for my behavior.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[254]:134,225
Maybe he’d want to give me some kind of pep talk, try to explain or justify our retreat.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[254]:225,283
Good, I thought, I’d listen patiently, put him at ease.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[254]:283,417
Then, when he rose to shake my hand, I’d draw my weapon and blow his Eastern brains against the map of what used to be our country.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[254]:417,562
Maybe his whole staff would be there, all the other little stooges who were “just following orders.” I’d get them all before they took me!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[254]:562,583
It would be perfect.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[254]:583,673
I wasn’t going to just goose-step my way into hell like some good little Hitler Jugend.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[254]:673,751
I’d show him, and everyone else, what it meant to be a real Deutsche Soldat.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[255]
But that’s not what happened.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[256]:0,4
No.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[256]:4,58
I did manage to make it into General Lang’s office.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[256]:58,98
We were the last unit across the canal.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[256]:98,122
He’d waited for that.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[256]:122,290
As soon as the report came in, he’d sat down at his desk, signed a few final orders, addressed and sealed a letter to his family, then put a bullet through his brain.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[257]:0,9
Bastard.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[257]:9,70
I hate him even more now than I did on the road from Hamburg.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[258]
Why is that?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[259]:0,83
Because I now understand why we did what we did, the details of the Prochnow Plan.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[259]:83,84
1
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[260]
Wouldn’t this revelation engender sympathy for him?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[261]:0,17
Are you kidding?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[261]:17,50
That’s exactly why I hate him!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[261]:50,161
He knew that this was just the first step of a long war and we were going to need men like him to help win it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[261]:161,177
Fucking coward.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[261]:177,239
Remember what I said about being beholden to your conscience?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[261]:239,348
You can’t blame anyone else, not the plan’s architect, not your commanding officer, no one but yourself.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[261]:348,451
You have to make your own choices and live every agonizing day with the consequences of those choices.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[261]:451,465
He knew this.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[261]:465,527
That’s why he deserted us like we deserted those civilians.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[261]:527,586
He saw the road ahead, a steep, treacherous mountain road.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[261]:586,684
We’d all have to hike that road, each of us dragging the boulder of what we’d done behind us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[261]:684,705
He couldn’t do it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[261]:705,739
He couldn’t shoulder the weight.

Dim, fluorescent bulbs illuminate the concrete walls and unwashed cots.

The patients here mainly suffer from respiratory disorders, many made worse by the lack of any usable medication.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[263]:211,313
There are no doctors here, and understaffed nurses and orderlies can do little to ease the suffering.

At least the room is warm and dry, and for this country in the dead of winter, that is a luxury beyond measure.

I don’t know how else to describe it, a complete breakdown of organization, of order, of control.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[265]:107,188
We’d just fought four brutal engagements: Luck, Rovno, Novograd, and Zhitomir.

What they’d seen, what they’d had to do, and all the time pulling back, rearguard actions, running.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[265]:349,444
Every day you heard about another town falling, another road closing, another unit overwhelmed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[266]:0,48
Kiev was supposed to be safe, behind the lines.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[266]:48,147
It was supposed to be the center of our new safety zone, well garrisoned, fully resupplied, quiet.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[266]:147,189
And so what happens as soon as we arrive?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[266]:189,222
Are my orders to rest and refit?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[266]:222,292
Repair my vehicles, reconstitute my numbers, rehabilitate my wounded?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[266]:292,311
No, of course not.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[266]:311,351
Why should things be as they should be?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[266]:351,379
They never have been before.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[267]:0,66
The safety zone was being shifted again, this time to the Crimea.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[267]:66,123
The government had already moved…fled…to Sevastopol.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[267]:123,150
Civil order had collapsed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[267]:150,182
Kiev was being fully evacuated.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[267]:182,240
This was the task of the military, or what was left of it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[268]:0,70
Our company was ordered to oversee the escape route at Patona Bridge.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[268]:70,213
It was the first all electrically welded bridge in the world, and many foreigners used to compare its achievement to that of the Eiffel Tower.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[268]:213,298
The city had planned a major restoration project, a dream to renew its former glory.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[268]:298,368
But, like everything else in our country, that dream never came true.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[268]:368,475
Even before the crisis, the bridge had been a nightmare of traffic jams. Now it was crammed with evacuees.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[268]:475,650
The bridge was supposed to be closed to road traffic, but where were the barricades we were promised, the concrete and steel that would have made any forced entry impossible?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[268]:650,798
Cars were everywhere, little Lags and old Zhigs, a few Mercedes, and a mammoth GAZ truck sitting right in the middle, just turned over on its side!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[268]:798,887
We tried to move it, get a chain around the axle and pull it free with one of the tanks.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[268]:887,901
Not a chance.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[268]:901,918
What could we do?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:0,44
We were an armored platoon, you understand.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:44,72
Tanks, not military police.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:72,94
We never saw any MPs.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:94,241
We were assured they would be there, but we never saw or heard from them, neither did any of the other “units” along any of the other bridges.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:241,282
To even call them “units” is a joke.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:282,438
These were just mobs of men in uniforms, clerks and cooks; anyone who happened to be attached to the military suddenly became in charge of traffic control.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:438,612
None of us were set up for this, weren’t trained for it, weren’t equipped…Where was the riot gear they promised us, the shields, the armor, where was the water cannon?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:612,659
Our orders were to “process” all evacuees.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:659,729
You understand “process,” to see if any of them had been tainted.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:729,770
But where were the goddamn sniffer dogs?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:770,828
How are you supposed to check for infection without dogs?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:828,888
What are you supposed to do, visually inspect each refugee?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:888,893
Yes!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:893,935
And yet, that is what we were told to do.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:935,1191
[Shakes his head.] Did they really think that those terrified, frantic wretches, with death at their backs and safety—perceived safety—only meters away were going to form an orderly line and let us strip them naked to examine every centimeter of skin?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:1191,1300
Did they think men would just stand by while we examined their wives, their mothers, their little daughters?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:1300,1317
Can you imagine?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:1317,1349
And we actually tried to do it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:1349,1383
What other alternative was there?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:1383,1444
They had to be separated if any of us were going to survive.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[269]:1444,1554
What’s the point of even trying to evacuate people if they’re just going to bring the infection with them?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[270]:0,55
[Shakes his head, laughs bitterly.] It was a disaster!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[270]:55,126
Some just refused, others tried to run by or even jump into the river.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[270]:126,144
Fights broke out.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[270]:144,265
Many of my men were beaten badly, three were stabbed, one was shot by a frightened grandfather with a rusty old Tokarev.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[270]:265,313
I’m sure he was dead before hitting the water.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[271]:0,34
I wasn’t there, you understand.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[271]:34,81
I was on the radio trying to call for support!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[271]:81,160
Help is coming, they kept saying, do not break, do not despair, help is coming.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[272]:0,33
Across the Dnieper, Kiev burned.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[272]:33,74
Black pillars rose from the city center.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[272]:74,165
We were downwind, the stench was terrible, the wood and rubber and stink of burning flesh.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[272]:165,236
We didn’t know how far they were now, maybe a kilometer, maybe less.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[272]:236,289
Up on the hill, the fire had engulfed the monastery.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[272]:289,306
Goddamn tragedy.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[272]:306,379
With its high walls, its strategic location, we could have made a stand.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[272]:379,528
Any first-year cadet could have turned it into an impregnable fortress—stocked the basements, sealed the gates, and mounted snipers in the towers.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[272]:528,585
They could have covered the bridge for…fucking forever!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[273]
I thought I heard something, a sound from the other bank…that sound, you know, when they are all together, when they are close, that…even over the shouts, the curses, the honking horns, the distant sniper fire, you know that sound.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[274]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[275]:0,73
[He attempts to mimic their moan but collapses into uncontrolled coughs.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[275]:73,115
He holds his handkerchief up to his face.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[275]:115,137
It comes away bloody.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[276]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[277]:0,51
That sound was what pulled me away from the radio.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[277]:51,78
I looked over at the city.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[277]:78,149
Something caught my eye, something above the rooftops and closing fast.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[278]:0,43
The jet streaked over us at treetop level.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[278]:43,135
There were four of them, Sukhoi 25 “Rooks,” close, and low enough to identify by sight.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[278]:135,217
What the hell, I thought, are they going to try to cover the bridge’s approach?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[278]:217,248
Maybe bomb the area behind it?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[278]:248,300
It had worked at Rovno, at least for a few minutes.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[278]:300,392
The Rooks circled, as if confirming their targets, then banked low and came straight at us!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[278]:392,456
Devil’s mother, I thought, they are going to bomb the bridge!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[278]:456,524
They’d given up on the evacuation and were going to kill everyone!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[279]:0,42
“Off the bridge!” I started shouting.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[279]:42,96
“Everyone get off!” Panic shot through the crowd.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[279]:96,157
You could see it like a wave, like a current of electricity.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[279]:157,231
People started screaming, trying to push forward, back, into one another.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[279]:231,329
Dozens were jumping into the water with heavy clothes and shoes that prevented them from swimming.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[280]:0,50
I was pulling people across, telling them to run.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[280]:50,153
I saw the bombs released, thought maybe I could dive at the last moment, shield myself from the blast.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[280]:153,193
Then the parachutes opened, and I knew.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[280]:193,259
In a split second, I was up and dashing like a frightened rabbit.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[280]:259,288
“Button up!” I screamed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[280]:288,401
“Button up!” I leapt onto the nearest tank, slammed the hatch down, and ordered the crew to check the seals!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[280]:401,432
The tank was an obsolete T-72.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[280]:432,521
We couldn’t know if the overpressure system still worked, hadn’t tested it in years.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[280]:521,591
All we could do was hope and pray while cringing in our steel coffin.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[280]:591,773
The gunner was sobbing, the driver was frozen, the commander, a junior sergeant just twenty years old, was balled up on the floor, clutching the little cross he had around his neck.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[280]:773,885
I put my hand on the top of his head, assured him we would be fine while keeping my eyes glued to the periscope.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[281]:0,43
RVX doesn’t start out as a gas, you see.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[281]:43,123
It starts out as rain: tiny, oily droplets that cling to whatever they contact.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[281]:123,173
It enters through the pores, the eyes, the lungs.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[281]:173,232
Depending on the dosage, the effects can be instantaneous.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[281]:232,378
I could see the evacuees’ limbs begin to tremble, arms falling to their sides as the agent worked its way through their central nervous system.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[281]:378,434
They rubbed their eyes, fought to speak, move, breathe.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[281]:434,544
I was glad I couldn’t smell the contents of their undergarments, the sudden discharge of bladder and bowels.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[282]:0,22
Why would they do it?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[282]:22,47
I couldn’t understand.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[282]:47,129
Didn’t the high command know that chemical weapons had no effect on the undead?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[282]:129,172
Didn’t they learn anything from Zhitomir?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[283]:0,179
The first corpse to move was a woman, just a second or more before the others, a twitching hand groping across the back of a man who looked like he’d been trying to shield her.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[283]:179,226
He slipped off as she rose on uncertain knees.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[283]:226,280
Her face was mottled and webbed with blackened veins.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[283]:280,313
I think she saw me, or our tank.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[283]:313,345
Her jaw dropped, her arms rose.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[283]:345,487
I could see the others coming to life, every fortieth or fiftieth person, everyone who had been bitten and had previously tried to conceal it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[284]:0,23
And then I understood.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[284]:23,123
Yes, they’d learned from Zhitomir, and now they found a better use for their cold war stockpiles.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[284]:123,185
How do you effectively separate the infected from the others?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[284]:185,257
How do you keep evacuees from spreading the infection behind the lines?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[284]:257,274
That’s one way.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[285]:0,110
They were starting to fully reanimate, regaining their footing, shuffling slowly across the bridge toward us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[285]:110,135
I called for the gunner.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[285]:135,171
He could barely stutter a response.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[285]:171,236
I kicked him in the back, barked the order to sight his targets!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[285]:236,333
It took a few seconds but he settled his crosshairs on the first woman and squeezed the trigger.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[285]:333,369
I held my ears as the Coax belched.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[285]:369,399
The other tanks followed suit.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[286]:0,35
Twenty minutes later, it was over.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[286]:35,134
I know I should have waited for orders, at least reported our status or the effects of the strike.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[286]:134,254
I could see six more flights of Rooks streaking over, five heading for the other bridges, the last for the city center.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[286]:254,328
I ordered our company to withdraw, to head southwest and just keep going.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[286]:328,432
There were a lot of bodies around us, the ones who’d just made it over the bridge before the gas hit.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[286]:432,464
They popped as we ran over them.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[287]:0,57
Have you been to the Great Patriotic War Museum Complex?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[287]:57,110
It was one of the most impressive buildings in Kiev.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[287]:110,224
The courtyard was filled with machines: tanks, guns, every class and size, from the Revolution to the modern day.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[287]:224,279
Two tanks faced each other at the museum’s entrance.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[287]:279,380
They were decorated with colorful drawings now, and children were allowed to climb and play on them.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[287]:380,499
There was an Iron Cross, a full meter in size, made from the hundreds of real Iron Crosses taken from dead Hitlerites.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[287]:499,565
There was a mural, from floor to ceiling, showing a grand battle.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[287]:565,707
Our soldiers were all connected, in a seething wave of strength and courage that crashed upon the Germans, that drove them from our homeland.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[287]:707,821
So many symbols of our national defense and none more spectacular than the statue of the Rodina Mat (Motherland).
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[287]:821,924
She was the tallest building in the city, a more than sixty-meter masterpiece of pure stainless steel.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[287]:924,1068
She was the last thing I saw in Kiev, her shield and sword held high in everlasting triumph, her cold, bright eyes looking down at us as we ran.

[Jesika Hendricks gestures to the expanse of subarctic wasteland.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[289]:66,214
The natural beauty has been replaced by wreckage: abandoned vehicles, debris, and human corpses remain partially frozen into the gray snow and ice.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[289]:214,339
Originally from Waukesha, Wisconsin, the now naturalized Canadian is part of this region’s Wilderness Restoration Project.

====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[290]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[291]:0,82
I don’t blame them, the government, the people who were supposed to protect us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[291]:82,121
Objectively, I guess I can understand.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[291]:121,203
They couldn’t have everyone following the army west behind the Rocky Mountains.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[291]:203,386
How were they going to feed all of us, how were they going to screen us, and how could they ever hope to stop the armies of undead that almost certainly would have been following us?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[291]:386,469
I can understand why they would want to divert as many refugees north as possible.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[291]:469,564
What else could they do, stop us at the Rockies with armed troops, gas us like the Ukrainians?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[291]:564,615
At least if we went north, we might have a chance.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[291]:615,700
Once the temperature dropped and the undead froze, some us might be able to survive.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[291]:700,814
That was happening all around the rest of the world, people fleeing north hoping to stay alive until winter came.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[291]:814,885
No, I don’t blame them for wanting to divert us, I can forgive that.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[291]:885,1026
But the irresponsible way they did it, the lack of vital information that would have helped so many to stay alive…that I can never forgive.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[292]:0,110
It was August, two weeks after Yonkers and just three days after the government had started withdrawing west.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[292]:110,166
We hadn’t had too many outbreaks in our neighborhood.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[292]:166,234
I’d only seen one, a collection of six feeding on a homeless man.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[292]:234,270
The cops had put them down quickly.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[292]:270,355
It happened three blocks from our house and that was when my father decided to leave.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[293]:0,120
We were in the living room; my father was learning how to load his new rifle while Mom finished nailing up the windows.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[293]:120,235
You couldn’t find a channel with anything but zombie news, either live images, or recorded footage from Yonkers.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[293]:235,312
Looking back, I still can’t believe how unprofessional the news media was.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[293]:312,345
So much spin, so few hard facts.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[293]:345,516
All those digestible sound bites from an army of “experts” all contradicting one another, all trying to seem more “shocking” and “in depth” than the last one.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[293]:516,575
It was all so confusing, nobody seemed to know what to do.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[293]:575,739
The only thing any of them could agree on was that all private citizens should “go north.” Because the living dead freeze solid, extreme cold is our only hope.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[293]:739,762
That’s all we heard.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[293]:762,971
No more instructions on where to head north, what to bring with us, how to survive, just that damn catchphrase you’d hear from every talking head, or just crawling over and over across the bottom of the TV.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[293]:971,984
“Go north.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[293]:984,994
Go north.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[293]:994,1006
Go north.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[294]:0,140
“That’s it,” Dad said, “we’re getting out of here tonight and heading north.” He tried to sound determined, slapping his rifle.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[294]:140,180
He’d never touched a gun in his life.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[294]:180,248
He was a gentleman in the most literal sense—he was a gentle man.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[294]:248,363
Short, bald, a pudgy face that turned red when he laughed, he was the king of the bad jokes and cheesy one-liners.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[294]:363,501
He always had something for you, a compliment or a smile, or a little extension to my allowance that Mom wasn’t supposed to know about.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[294]:501,573
He was the good cop in the family, he left all the big decisions to Mom.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[295]:0,54
Now Mom tried to argue, tried to make him see reason.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[295]:54,105
We lived above the snowline, we had all we needed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[295]:105,245
Why trek into the unknown when we could just stock up on supplies, continue to fortify the house, and just wait until the first fall frost?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[295]:245,269
Dad wouldn’t hear it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[295]:269,330
We could be dead by the fall, we could be dead by next week!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[295]:330,370
He was so caught up in the Great Panic.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[295]:370,424
He told us it would be like an extended camping trip.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[295]:424,477
We’d live on mooseburgers and wild berry desserts.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[295]:477,580
He promised to teach me how to fish and asked me what I wanted to name my pet rabbit when I caught it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[295]:580,621
He’d lived in Waukesha his whole life.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[295]:621,647
He’d never been camping.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[296]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[297]
[She shows me something in the ice, a collection of cracked DVDs.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[298]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[299]:0,85
This is what people brought with them: hair dryers, GameCubes, laptops by the dozen.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[299]:85,155
I don’t think they were stupid enough to think they could use them.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[299]:155,171
Maybe some did.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[299]:171,294
I think most people were just afraid of losing them, that they’d come home after six months and find their homes looted.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[299]:294,340
We actually thought we were packing sensibly.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[299]:340,446
Warm clothes, cooking utensils, things from the medicine cabinet, and all the canned food we could carry.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[299]:446,496
It looked like enough food for a couple of years.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[299]:496,534
We finished half of it on the way up.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[299]:534,559
That didn’t bother me.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[299]:559,600
It was like an adventure, the trek north.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[300]:0,83
All those stories you hear about the clogged roads and violence, that wasn’t us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[300]:83,110
We were in the first wave.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[300]:110,199
The only people ahead of us were the Canadians, and most of them were already long gone.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[300]:199,373
There was still a lot of traffic on the road, more cars than I’d ever seen, but it all moved pretty quickly, and only really snarled in places like roadside towns or parks.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[301]
Parks?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[302]:0,88
Parks, designated campgrounds, any place where people thought they’d gone far enough.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[302]:88,169
Dad used to look down on those people, calling them shortsighted and irrational.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[302]:169,305
He said that we were still way too close to population centers and the only way to really make it was to head as far north as we could.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[302]:305,403
Mom would always argue that it wasn’t their fault, that most of them had simply run out of gas.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[302]:403,449
“And whose fault is that,” Dad would say.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[302]:449,508
We had a lot of spare gas cans on the roof of the minivan.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[302]:508,568
Dad had been stocking up since the first days of the Panic.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[302]:568,709
We’d pass a lot of traffic snarls around roadside gas stations, most of which already had these giant signs outside that said NO MORE GAS.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[302]:709,740
Dad drove by them really fast.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[302]:740,845
He drove fast by a lot of things, the stalled cars that needed a jump, or hitchhikers who needed a ride.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[302]:845,991
There were a lot of those, in some cases, walking in lines by the side of the road, looking like the way you think refugees are supposed to look.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[302]:991,1085
Every now and then a car would stop to pick up a couple, and suddenly everyone wanted a ride.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[302]:1085,1139
“See what they got themselves into?” That was Dad.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:0,92
We did pick up one woman, walking by herself and pulling one of those wheeled airline bags.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:92,143
She looked pretty harmless, all alone in the rain.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:143,199
That’s probably why Mom made Dad stop to pick her up.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:199,242
Her name was Patty, she was from Winnipeg.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:242,305
She didn’t tell us how she got out here and we didn’t ask.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:305,381
She was really grateful and tried to give my parents all the money she had.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:381,454
Mom wouldn’t let her and promised to take her as far as we were going.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:454,487
She started crying, thanking us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:487,606
I was proud of my parents for doing the right thing, until she sneezed and brought up a handkerchief to blow her nose.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:606,667
Her left hand had been in her pocket since we picked her up.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:667,756
We could see that it was wrapped in a cloth and had a dark stain that looked like blood.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:756,805
She saw that we saw and suddenly looked nervous.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:805,872
She told us not to worry and that she’d just cut it by accident.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:872,921
Dad looked at Mom, and they both got very quiet.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:921,977
They wouldn’t look at me, they didn’t say anything.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:977,1041
That night I woke up when I heard the passenger door slam shut.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:1041,1083
I didn’t think it was anything unusual.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:1083,1128
We were always stopping for bathroom breaks.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:1128,1263
They always woke me up just in case I had to go, but this time I didn’t know what had happened until the minivan was already moving.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:1263,1308
I looked around for Patty, but she was gone.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:1308,1398
I asked my parents what had happened and they told me she’d asked them to drop her off.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:1398,1502
I looked behind us and thought I could just make her out, this little spec getting smaller each second.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:1502,1608
I thought she looked like she was running after us, but I was so tired and confused I couldn’t be sure.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:1608,1647
I probably just didn’t want to know.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[303]:1647,1688
I shut a lot out during that drive north.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[304]
Like what?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[305]:0,61
Like the other “hitchhikers,” the ones who didn’t run.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[305]:61,132
There weren’t a lot, remember, we’re talking about the first wave.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[305]:132,246
We encountered half a dozen at most, wandering down the middle of the road, raising their arms when we got close.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[305]:246,317
Dad would weave around them and Mom would tell me to get my head down.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[305]:317,345
I never saw them too close.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[305]:345,394
I had my face against the seat and my eyes shut.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[305]:394,423
I didn’t want to see them.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[305]:423,481
I just kept thinking about mooseburgers and wild berries.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[305]:481,523
It was like heading to the Promised Land.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[305]:523,593
I knew once we headed far enough north, everything would be all right.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[306]:0,27
For a little while it was.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[306]:27,196
We had this great campsite right on the shore of a lake, not too many people around, but just enough to make us feel “safe,” you know, if any of the dead showed up.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[306]:196,261
Everyone was real friendly, this big, collective vibe of relief.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[306]:261,299
It was kind of like a party at first.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[306]:299,412
There were these big cookouts every night, people all throwing in what they’d hunted or fished, mostly fished.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[306]:412,542
Some guys would throw dynamite in the lake and there’d be this huge bang and all these fish would come floating to the surface.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[306]:542,699
I’ll never forget those sounds, the explosions or the chainsaws as people cut down trees, or the music of car radios and instruments families had brought.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[306]:699,797
We all sang around the campfires at night, these giant bonfires of logs stacked up on one another.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[307]:0,194
That was when we still had trees, before the second and third waves starting showing up, when people were down to burning leaves and stumps, then finally whatever they could get their hands on.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[307]:194,271
The smell of plastic and rubber got really bad, in your mouth, in your hair.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[307]:271,346
By that time the fish were all gone, and anything left for people to hunt.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[307]:346,370
No one seemed to worry.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[307]:370,420
Everyone was counting on winter freezing the dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[308]
But once the dead were frozen, how were you going to survive the winter?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[309]:0,15
Good question.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[309]:15,67
I don’t think most people thought that far ahead.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[309]:67,181
Maybe they figured that the “authorities” would come rescue us or that they could just pack up and head home.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[309]:181,366
I’m sure a lot of people didn’t think about anything except the day in front of them, just grateful that they were finally safe and confident that things would work themselves out.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[309]:366,430
“We’ll all be home before you know it,” people would say.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[309]:430,469
“It’ll all be over by Christmas.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[310]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[311]:0,93
[She draws my attention to another object in the ice, a Sponge-Bob SquarePants sleeping bag.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[311]:93,125
It is small, and stained brown.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[312]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[313]:0,75
What do you think this is rated to, a heated bedroom at a sleepover party?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[313]:75,251
Okay, maybe they couldn’t get a proper bag—camping stores were always the first bought out or knocked off—but you can’t believe how ignorant some of these people were.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[313]:251,328
A lot of them were from Sunbelt states, some as far away as southern Mexico.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[313]:328,458
You’d see people getting into their sleeping bags with their boots on, not realizing that it was cutting off their circulation.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[313]:458,583
You’d see them drinking to get warm, not realizing it was actually lowering their temperature by releasing more body heat.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[313]:583,669
You’d see them wearing these big heavy coats with nothing but a T-shirt underneath.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[313]:669,730
They’d do something physical, overheat, take off the coat.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[313]:730,814
Their bodies’d be coated in sweat, a lot of cotton cloth holding in the moisture.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[313]:814,886
The breeze’d come up…a lot of people got sick that first September.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[313]:886,900
Cold and flu.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[313]:900,931
They gave it to the rest of us.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[314]:0,40
In the beginning everyone was friendly.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[314]:40,55
We cooperated.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[314]:55,116
We traded or even bought what we needed from other families.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[314]:116,149
Money was still worth something.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[314]:149,201
Everyone thought the banks would be reopening soon.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[314]:201,291
Whenever Mom and Dad would go looking for food, they’d always leave me with a neighbor.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[314]:291,401
I had this little survival radio, the kind you cranked for power, so we could listen to the news every night.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[314]:401,472
It was all stories of the pullout, army units leaving people stranded.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[314]:472,595
We’d listen with our road map of the United States, pointing to the cities and towns where the reports were coming from.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[314]:595,621
I’d sit on Dad’s lap.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[314]:621,678
“See,” he’d say, “they didn’t get out in time.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[314]:678,740
They weren’t smart like us.” He’d try to force a smile.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[314]:740,783
For a little while, I thought he was right.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[315]:0,127
But after the first month, when the food started running out, and the days got colder and darker, people started getting mean.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[315]:127,191
There were no more communal fires, no more cookouts or singing.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[315]:191,254
The camp became a mess, nobody picking up their trash anymore.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[315]:254,294
A couple times I stepped in human shit.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[315]:294,331
Nobody was even bothering to bury it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[316]:0,80
I wasn’t left alone with neighbors anymore, my parents didn’t trust anyone.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[316]:80,131
Things got dangerous, you’d see a lot of fights.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[316]:131,205
I saw two women wrestling over a fur coat, tore it right down the middle.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[316]:205,321
I saw one guy catching another guy trying to steal some stuff out of his car and beat his head in with a tire iron.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[316]:321,376
A lot of it took place at night, scuffling and shouts.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[316]:376,440
Every now and then you’d hear a gunshot, and somebody crying.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[316]:440,532
One time we heard someone moving outside the makeshift tent we’d draped over the minivan.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[316]:532,583
Mom told me to put my head down and cover my ears.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[316]:583,601
Dad went outside.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[316]:601,634
Through my hands I heard shouts.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[316]:634,656
Dad’s gun went off.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[316]:656,674
Someone screamed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[316]:674,712
Dad came back in, his face was white.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[316]:712,744
I never asked him what happened.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[317]:0,76
The only time anyone ever came together was when one of the dead showed up.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[317]:76,161
These were the ones who’d followed the third wave, coming alone or in small packs.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[317]:161,195
It happened every couple of days.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[317]:195,267
Someone would sound an alarm and everyone would rally to take them out.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[317]:267,337
And then, as soon as it was over, we’d all turn on each other again.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[318]
When it got cold enough to freeze the lake, when the last of the dead stopped showing up, a lot of people thought it was safe enough to try to walk home.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[319]:0,6
Walk?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[319]:6,16
Not drive?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[320]:0,13
No more gas.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[320]:13,97
They’d used it all up for cooking fuel or just to keep their car heaters running.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[320]:97,291
Every day there’d be these groups of half-starved, ragged wretches, all loaded down with all this useless stuff they’d brought with them, all with this look of desperate hope on their faces.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[321]:0,58
“Where do they think they’re going?” Dad would say.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[321]:58,130
“Don’t they know that it hasn’t gotten cold enough farther south?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[321]:130,291
Don’t they know what’s still waiting for them back there?” He was convinced that if we just held out long enough, sooner or later things would get better.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[321]:291,351
That was in October, when I still looked like a human being.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[322]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[323]:0,56
[We come upon a collection of bones, too many to count.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[323]:56,96
They lie in a pit, half covered in ice.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[324]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:0,26
I was a pretty heavy kid.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:26,82
I never played sports, I lived on fast food and snacks.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:82,141
I was only a little bit thinner when we arrived in August.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:141,177
By November, I was like a skeleton.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:177,216
Mom and Dad didn’t look much better.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:216,273
Dad’s tummy was gone, Mom had these narrow cheekbones.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:273,326
They were fighting a lot, fighting about everything.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:326,361
That scared me more than anything.

They’d never raised their voices at home.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:405,538
They were schoolteachers, “progressives.” There might have been a tense, quiet dinner every now and then, but nothing like this.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:538,586
They went for each other every chance they had.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:586,659
One time, around Thanksgiving…I couldn’t get out of my sleeping bag.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:659,724
My belly was swollen and I had these sores on my mouth and nose.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:724,778
There was this smell coming from the neighbor’s RV.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:778,837
They were cooking something, meat, it smelled really good.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:837,871
Mom and Dad were outside arguing.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:871,907
Mom said “it” was the only way.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:907,942
I didn’t know what “it” was.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:942,1157
She said “it” wasn’t “that bad” because the neighbors, not us, had been the ones to actually “do it.” Dad said that we weren’t going to stoop to that level and that Mom should be ashamed of herself.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1157,1257
Mom really laid into Dad, screeching that it was all his fault that we were here, that I was dying.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1257,1309
Mom told him that a real man would know what to do.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1309,1441
She called him a wimp and said he wanted us to die so then he could run away and live like the “faggot” she always knew he was.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1441,1475
Dad told her to shut the fuck up.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1475,1492
Dad never swore.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1492,1533
I heard something, a crack from outside.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1533,1595
Mom came back in, holding a clump of snow over her right eye.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1595,1613
Dad followed her.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1613,1639
He didn’t say anything.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1639,1725
He had this look on his face I’d never seen before, like he was a different person.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1725,1847
He grabbed my survival radio, the one people’d try to buy…or steal, for a long time, and went back out toward the RV.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1847,1946
He came back ten minutes later, without the radio but with a big bucket of this steaming hot stew.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1946,1962
It was so good!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1962,1995
Mom told me not to eat too fast.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:1995,2027
She fed me in little spoonfuls.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:2027,2048
She looked relieved.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:2048,2073
She was crying a little.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:2073,2098
Dad still had that look.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[325]:2098,2191
The look I had myself in a few months, when Mom and Dad both got sick and I had to feed them.

Winter really hit us in early December.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[329]:40,132
The snow was over our heads, literally, mountains of it, thick and gray from the pollution.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[329]:132,153
The camp got silent.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[329]:153,187
No more fights, no more shooting.

They say eleven million people died that winter, and that’s just in North America.

That doesn’t count the other places: Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[333]:157,329
I don’t want to think about Siberia, all those refugees from southern China, the ones from Japan who’d never been outside a city, and all those poor people from India.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[333]:329,417
That was the first Gray Winter, when the filth in the sky started changing the weather.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[333]:417,505
They say that a part of that filth, I don’t know how much, was ash from human remains.

It took a lot of time, but eventually the sun did come out, the weather began to warm, the snow finally began to melt.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[337]:119,185
By mid-July, spring was finally here, and so were the living dead.

Why do they come back after freezing?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[341]:38,76
All human cells contain water, right?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[341]:76,143
And when that water freezes, it expands and bursts the cell walls.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[341]:143,256
That’s why you can’t just freeze people in suspended animation, so then why does it work for the living dead?

I remember the monkeys, hundreds of them, climbing and skittering among the vehicles, even over the tops of people’s heads.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:126,243
I’d watched them as far back as Chandigarh, leaping from roofs and balconies as the living dead filled the street.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:243,413
I remember them scattering, chattering, scrambling straight up telephone poles to escape the zombies’ grasping arms. Some didn’t even wait to be attacked; they knew.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:413,484
And now they were here, on this narrow, twisting Himalayan goat track.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:484,565
They called it a road, but even in peacetime it had been a notorious death trap.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:565,661
Thousands of refugees were streaming past, or climbing over the stalled and abandoned vehicles.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:661,788
People were still trying to struggle with suitcases, boxes; one man was stubbornly holding on to the monitor for a desktop PC.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:788,942
A monkey landed on his head, trying to use it as a stepping-stone, but the man was too close to the edge and the two of them went tumbling over the side.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:942,1004
It seemed like every second someone would lose their footing.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:1004,1037
There were just too many people.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:1037,1078
The road didn’t even have a guardrail.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:1078,1155
I saw a whole bus go over, I don’t even know how, it wasn’t even moving.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:1155,1261
Passengers were climbing out of the windows because the doors of the bus had been jammed by foot traffic.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:1261,1324
One woman was halfway out the window when the bus tipped over.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:1324,1386
Something was in her arms, something clutched tightly to her.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:1386,1474
I tell myself that it wasn’t moving, or crying, that it was just a bundle of clothes.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:1474,1521
No one within arm’s reach tried to help her.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:1521,1570
No one even looked, they just kept streaming by.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[348]:1570,1671
Sometimes when I dream about that moment, I can’t tell the difference between them and the monkeys.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[349]:0,68
I wasn’t supposed to be there, I wasn’t even a combat engineer.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[349]:68,136
I was with the BRO 1 ; my job was to build roads, not blow them up.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[349]:136,354
I’d just been wandering through the assembly area at Shimla, trying to find what remained of my unit, when this engineer, Sergeant Mukherjee, grabbed me by the arm and said, “You, soldier, you know how to drive?”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[350]:0,193
I think I stammered something to the affirmative, and suddenly he was shoving me into the driver’s side of a jeep while he jumped in next to me with some kind of radiolike device on his lap.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[350]:193,218
“Get back to the pass!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[350]:218,222
Go!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[350]:222,393
Go!” I took off down the road, screeching and skidding and trying desperately to explain that I was actually a steamroller driver, and not even fully qualified at that.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[350]:393,421
Mukherjee didn’t hear me.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[350]:421,474
He was too busy fiddling with the device on his lap.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[350]:474,523
“The charges are already set,” he explained.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[350]:523,569
“All we have to do is wait for the order!”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[351]:0,29
“What charges?” I asked.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[351]:29,46
“What order?”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[352]:0,112
“To blow the pass, you arse head!” he yelled, motioning to what I now recognized as a detonator on his lap.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[352]:112,162
“How the hell else are we going to stop them?”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[353]:0,189
I knew, vaguely, that our retreat into the Himalayas had something to do with some kind of master plan, and that part of that plan meant closing all the mountain passes to the living dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[353]:189,257
I never dreamed, however, that I would be such a vital participant!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[353]:257,452
For the sake of civil conversation, I will not repeat my profane reaction to Mukherjee, nor Mukherjee’s equally profane reaction when we arrived at the pass and found it still full of refugees.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[354]:0,47
“It’s supposed to be clear!” he shouted.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[354]:47,70
“No more refugees!”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[355]:0,152
We noticed a soldier from the Rashtriya Rifles, the outfit that was supposed to be securing the road’s mountain entrance, come running past the jeep.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[355]:152,194
Mukherjee jumped out and grabbed the man.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[355]:194,268
“What the hell is this?” he asked; he was a big man, tough and angry.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[355]:268,365
“You were supposed to keep the road clear.” The other man was just as angry, just as scared.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[355]:365,461
“You want to shoot your grandmother, go ahead!” He shoved the sergeant aside and kept going.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[356]:0,78
Mukherjee keyed his radio and reported that the road was still highly active.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[356]:78,242
A voice came back to him, a high-pitched, frantic younger voice of an officer screaming that his orders were to blow the road no matter how many people were on it.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[356]:242,309
Mukherjee responded angrily that he had to wait till it was clear.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[356]:309,454
If we blew it now, not only would we be sending dozens of people hurtling to their deaths, but we would be trapping thousands on the other side.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[356]:454,608
The voice shot back that the road would never be clear, that the only thing behind those people was a raging swarm of God knows how many million zombies.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[356]:608,701
Mukherjee answered that he would blow it when the zombies got here, and not a second before.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[356]:701,777
He wasn’t about to commit murder no matter what some pissant lieutenant…
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[357]:0,80
But then Mukherjee stopped in midsentence and looked at something over my head.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[357]:80,168
I whipped around, and suddenly found myself staring into the face of General Raj-Singh!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[357]:168,298
I don’t know where he came from, why he was there…to this day no one believes me, not that he wasn’t there, but that I was.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[357]:298,351
I was inches away from him, from the Tiger of Delhi!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[357]:351,463
I’ve heard that people tend to view those they respect as appearing physically taller than they actually are.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[357]:463,506
In my mind, he appears as a virtual giant.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[357]:506,704
Even with his torn uniform, his bloody turban, the patch on his right eye and the bandage on his nose (one of his men had smashed him in the face to get him on the last chopper out of Gandhi Park).
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[357]:704,724
General Raj-Singh…
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[358]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[359]
[Khan takes a deep breath, his chest filling with pride.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[360]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[361]:0,135
“Gentlemen,” he began…he called us “Gentlemen” and explained, very carefully, that the road had to be destroyed immediately.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[361]:135,237
The air force, what was left of it, had its own orders concerning the closure of all mountain passes.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[361]:237,329
At this moment, a single Shamsher fighter bomber was already on station above our position.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[361]:329,524
If we found ourselves unable, or unwilling, to accomplish our mission, then the Jaguar’s pilot was ordered to execute “Shiva’s Wrath.” “Do you know what that means?” Raj-Singh asked.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[361]:524,819
Maybe he thought I was too young to understand, or maybe he must have guessed, somehow, that I was Muslim, but even if I’d known absolutely nothing about the Hindu deity of destruction, everyone in uniform had heard rumors about the “secret” code name for the use of thermonuclear weapons.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[362]
Wouldn’t that have destroyed the pass?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[363]:0,36
Yes, and half the mountain as well!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[363]:36,168
Instead of a narrow choke point hemmed in by sheer cliff walls, you would have had little more than a massive, gently sloping ramp.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[363]:168,400
The whole point of destroying these roads was to create a barrier inaccessible to the living dead, and now some ignorant air force general with an atomic erection was going to give them the perfect entrance right into the safe zone!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[364]:0,95
Mukherjee gulped, not sure of what to do, until the Tiger held out his hand for the detonator.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[364]:95,168
Ever the hero, he was now willing to accept the burden of mass murderer.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[364]:168,213
The sergeant handed it over, close to tears.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[364]:213,333
General Raj-Singh thanked him, thanked us both, whispered a prayer, then pressed his thumbs down on the firing buttons.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[364]:333,380
Nothing happened, he tried again, no response.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[364]:380,451
He checked the batteries, all the connections, and tried a third time.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[364]:451,460
Nothing.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[364]:460,496
The problem wasn’t the detonator.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[364]:496,627
Something had gone wrong with the charges that were buried half a kilometer down the road, set right in the middle of the refugees.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[365]:0,54
This is the end, I thought, we’re all going to die.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[365]:54,151
All I could think of was getting out of there, far enough away to maybe avoid the nuclear blast.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[365]:151,238
I still feel guilty about those thoughts, caring only for myself in a moment like that.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[366]:0,33
Thank God for General Raj-Singh.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[366]:33,101
He reacted…exactly how you would expect a living legend to react.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[366]:101,207
He ordered us to get out of here, save ourselves and get to Shimla, then turned and ran right into crowd.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[366]:207,313
Mukherjee and I looked at each other, without much hesitation, I’m happy to say, and took off after him.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:0,87
Now we wanted to be heroes, too, to protect our general and shield him from the crowd.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:87,100
What a joke.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:100,172
We never even saw him once the masses enveloped us like a raging river.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:172,217
I was pushed and shoved from all directions.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:217,263
I don’t know when I was punched in the eye.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:263,329
I shouted that I needed to get past, that this was army business.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:329,346
No one listened.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:346,380
I fired several shots in the air.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:380,396
No one noticed.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:396,441
I considered actually firing into the crowd.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:441,478
I was becoming as desperate as them.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:478,595
Out of the corner of my eye I saw Mukherjee go tumbling over the side with another man still fighting for his rifle.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:595,668
I turned to tell General Raj-Singh but couldn’t find him in the crowd.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:668,728
I called his name, tried to spot him above the other heads.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:728,794
I climbed onto the roof of a microbus, trying to get my bearings.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:794,876
Then the wind came up; it brought the stink and moan whipping through the valley.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:876,947
In front of me, about half a kilometer ahead, the crowd began running.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:947,978
I strained my eyes…squinted.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:978,1000
The dead were coming.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[367]:1000,1084
Slow and deliberate, and just as tightly packed as the refugees they were devouring.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:0,31
The microbus shook and I fell.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:31,155
First I was floating on a sea of human bodies, then suddenly I was beneath them, shoes and bare feet trampling on my flesh.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:155,205
I felt my ribs crack, I coughed and tasted blood.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:205,241
I pulled myself under the microbus.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:241,270
My body was aching, burning.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:270,290
I couldn’t speak.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:290,310
I could barely see.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:310,356
I heard the sound of the approaching zombies.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:356,425
I guessed that they couldn’t be more than two hundred meters away.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:425,586
I swore I wouldn’t die like the others, all those victims torn to pieces, that cow I saw struggling and bleeding on the banks of the Satluj River in Rupnagar.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:586,637
I fumbled for my sidearm, my hand wouldn’t work.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:637,657
I cursed and cried.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:657,796
I thought I’d be religious at that point, but I was just so scared and angry I started beating my head against the underside of the van.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:796,860
I thought if I hit it hard enough I could bash in my own skull.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:860,934
Suddenly there was a deafening roar and the ground rose up underneath me.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:934,1014
A wave of screams and moans mixed with this powerful blast of pressurized dust.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[368]:1014,1073
My face slammed into the machinery above, knocking me cold.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[369]:0,66
The first thing I remember when I came to was a very faint sound.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[369]:66,99
At first I thought it was water.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[369]:99,153
It sounded like a fast drip…tap-tap-tap, like that.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[369]:153,347
The tap became clearer, and I suddenly became aware of two other sounds, the crackle of my radio…how that wasn’t smashed I’ll never know…and the ever-present howling of the living dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[369]:347,386
I crawled out from under the microbus.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[369]:386,444
At least my legs were still working well enough to stand.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[369]:444,508
I realized that I was alone, no refugees, no General Raj-Singh.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[369]:508,618
I was standing among a collection of discarded personal belongings in the middle of a deserted mountain path.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[369]:618,659
In front of me was a charred cliff wall.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[369]:659,708
Beyond it was the other side of the severed road.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[370]:0,41
That’s where the moan was coming from.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[370]:41,83
The living dead were still coming for me.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[370]:83,174
With eyes front and arms outstretched, they were falling in droves off the shattered edge.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[370]:174,254
That was the tapping sound: their bodies smashing on the valley floor far below.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[371]:0,60
The Tiger must have set the demolition charges off by hand.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[371]:60,130
I guessed he must have reached them the same time as the living dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[371]:130,181
I hope they didn’t get their teeth in him first.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[371]:181,278
I hope he’s pleased with his statue that now stands over a modern, four-lane mountain freeway.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[371]:278,334
I wasn’t thinking about his sacrifice at that moment.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[371]:334,380
I wasn’t even sure if any of this was real.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[371]:380,473
Staring silently at this undead waterfall, listening to my radio report from the other units:
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[372]
“Vikasnagar: Secure.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[373]
“Bilaspur: Secure.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[374]
“Jawala Mukhi: Secure.”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[375]
“All passes report secure: Over!”
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[376]
Am I dreaming, I thought, am I insane?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[377]:0,38
The monkey didn’t help matters any.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[377]:38,123
He was sitting on top of the microbus, just watching the undead plunge to their end.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[377]:123,209
His face appeared so serene, so intelligent, as if he truly understood the situation.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[377]:209,293
I almost wanted him to turn to me and say, “This is the turning point of the war!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[377]:293,323
We’ve finally stopped them!
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[377]:323,411
We’re finally safe!” But instead his little penis popped out and he peed in my face.

TAOS, NEW MEXICO

[Arthur Sinclair, Junior, is the picture of an old-world patrician: tall, lean, with close-cropped white hair and an affected Harvard accent.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[381]:142,220
He speaks into the ether, rarely making eye contact or pausing for questions.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[381]:220,277
During the war, Mister Sinclair was director of the U.S.

/html/body/div/div[5]/p[381]:277,352
government’s newly formed DeStRes, or Department of Strategic Resources.]
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[382]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[383]:0,186
I don’t know who first thought of the acronym “DeStRes” or if they consciously knew how much it sounded like “distress,” but it certainly could not have been more appropriate.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[383]:186,355
Establishing a defensive line at the Rocky Mountains might have created a theoretical “safe zone,” but in reality that zone consisted mainly of rubble and refugees.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[383]:355,416
There was starvation, disease, homelessness in the millions.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[383]:416,600
Industry was in shambles, transportation and trade had evaporated, and all of this was compounded by the living dead both assaulting the Rocky Line and festering within our safe zone.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[383]:600,760
We had to get our people on their feet again—clothed, fed, housed, and back to work—otherwise this supposed safe zone was only forestalling the inevitable.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[383]:760,864
That was why the DeStRes was created, and, as you can imagine, I had to do a lot of on-the-job training.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[384]:0,233
Those first months, I can’t tell you how much information I had to cram into this withered old cortex; the briefings, the inspection tours…when I did sleep, it was with a book under my pillow, each night a new one, from Henry J.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[384]:233,259
Kaiser to Vo Nguyen Giap.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[384]:259,404
I needed every idea, every word, every ounce of knowledge and wisdom to help me fuse a fractured landscape into the modern American war machine.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[384]:404,483
If my father had been alive, he probably would have laughed at my frustration.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[384]:483,576
He’d been a staunch New Dealer, working closely with FDR as comptroller of New York State.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[384]:576,741
He used methods that were almost Marxist in nature, the kind of collectivization that would make Ayn Rand leap from her grave and join the ranks of the living dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[384]:741,852
I’d always rejected the lessons he’d tried to impart, running as far away as Wall Street to shut them out.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[384]:852,899
Now I was wracking my brains to remember them.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[384]:899,1026
One thing those New Dealers did better than any generation in American history was find and harvest the right tools and talent.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[385]
Tools and talent?
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[386]:0,41
A term my son had heard once in a movie.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[386]:41,102
I found it described our reconstruction efforts rather well.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[386]:102,228
“Talent” describes the potential workforce, its level of skilled labor, and how that labor could be utilized effectively.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[386]:228,296
To be perfectly candid, our supply of talent was at a critical low.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[386]:296,487
Ours was a postindustrial or service-based economy, so complex and highly specialized that each individual could only function within the confines of its narrow, compartmentalized structure.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[386]:487,780
You should have seen some of the “careers” listed on our first employment census; everyone was some version of an “executive,” a “representative,” an “analyst,” or a “consultant,” all perfectly suited to the prewar world, but all totally inadequate for the present crisis.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[386]:780,833
We needed carpenters, masons, machinists, gunsmiths.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[386]:833,908
We had those people, to be sure, but not nearly as many as were necessary.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[386]:908,1053
The first labor survey stated clearly that over 65 percent of the present civilian workforce were classified F-6, possessing no valued vocation.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[386]:1053,1099
We required a massive job retraining program.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[386]:1099,1155
In short, we needed to get a lot of white collars dirty.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[387]:0,19
It was slow going.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[387]:19,201
Air traffic was nonexistent, roads and rail lines were a shambles, and fuel, good Lord, you couldn’t find a tank of gas between Blaine, Washington, and Imperial Beach, California.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[387]:201,367
Add to this the fact that prewar America not only had a commuter-based infrastructure, but that such a method also allowed for severe levels of economic segregation.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[387]:367,529
You would have entire suburban neighborhoods of upper-middle-class professionals, none of whom had possessed even the basic know-how to replace a cracked window.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[387]:529,687
Those with that knowledge lived in their own blue-collar “ghettos,” an hour away in prewar auto traffic, which translated to at least a full day on foot.
====
/html/body/div/div[5]/p[387]:687,769
Make no mistake, bipedal locomotion was how most people traveled in the beginning.
====
/html/body/div/p[5]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[6]:0,85
Solving this problem—no, challenge, there are no problems—was the refugee camps.
====
/html/body/div/p[6]:85,294
There were hundreds of them, some parking-lot small, some spreading for miles, scattered across the mountains and coast, all requiring government assistance, all acute drains on rapidly diminishing resources.
====
/html/body/div/p[6]:294,386
At the top of my list, before I tackled any other challenge, these camps had to be emptied.
====
/html/body/div/p[6]:386,492
Anyone F-6 but physically able became unskilled labor: clearing rubble, harvesting crops, digging graves.
====
/html/body/div/p[6]:492,526
A lot of graves needed to be dug.
====
/html/body/div/p[6]:526,637
Anyone A-1, those with war-appropriate skills, became part of our CSSP, or Community Self-Sufficiency Program.
====
/html/body/div/p[6]:637,805
A mixed group of instructors would be tasked with infusing these sedentary, overeducated, desk-bound, cubicle mice with the knowledge necessary to make it on their own.
====
/html/body/div/p[7]:0,27
It was an instant success.
====
/html/body/div/p[7]:27,101
Within three months you saw a marked drop in requests for government aid.
====
/html/body/div/p[7]:101,149
I can’t stress how vital this was to victory.
====
/html/body/div/p[7]:149,250
It allowed us to transition from a zero-sum, survival-based economy, into full-blown war production.
====
/html/body/div/p[7]:250,324
This was the National Reeducation Act, the organic outgrowth of the CSSP.
====
/html/body/div/p[7]:324,446
I’d say it was the largest jobs training program since the Second World War, and easily the most radical in our history.
====
/html/body/div/p[8]
You’ve mentioned, on occasion, the problems faced by the NRA…
====
/html/body/div/p[9]:0,23
I was getting to that.
====
/html/body/div/p[9]:23,118
The president gave me the kind of power I needed to meet any physical or logistical challenge.
====
/html/body/div/p[9]:118,231
Unfortunately, what neither he nor anyone on Earth could give me was the power to change the way people thought.
====
/html/body/div/p[9]:231,349
As I explained, America was a segregated workforce, and in many cases, that segregation contained a cultural element.
====
/html/body/div/p[9]:349,415
A great many of our instructors were first-generation immigrants.
====
/html/body/div/p[9]:415,537
These were the people who knew how to take care of themselves, how to survive on very little and work with what they had.
====
/html/body/div/p[9]:537,706
These were the people who tended small gardens in their backyards, who repaired their own homes, who kept their appliances running for as long as mechanically possible.
====
/html/body/div/p[9]:706,906
It was crucial that these people teach the rest of us to break from our comfortable, disposable consumer lifestyle even though their labor had allowed us to maintain that lifestyle in the first place.
====
/html/body/div/p[10]:0,52
Yes, there was racism, but there was also classism.
====
/html/body/div/p[10]:52,96
You’re a high-powered corporate attorney.
====
/html/body/div/p[10]:96,189
You’ve spent most of your life reviewing contracts, brokering deals, talking on the phone.
====
/html/body/div/p[10]:189,356
That’s what you’re good at, that’s what made you rich and what allowed you to hire a plumber to fix your toilet, which allowed you to keep talking on the phone.
====
/html/body/div/p[10]:356,462
The more work you do, the more money you make, the more peons you hire to free you up to make more money.
====
/html/body/div/p[10]:462,496
That’s the way the world works.
====
/html/body/div/p[10]:496,522
But one day it doesn’t.
====
/html/body/div/p[10]:522,575
No one needs a contract reviewed or a deal brokered.
====
/html/body/div/p[10]:575,611
What it does need is toilets fixed.
====
/html/body/div/p[10]:611,673
And suddenly that peon is your teacher, maybe even your boss.
====
/html/body/div/p[10]:673,721
For some, this was scarier than the living dead.
====
/html/body/div/p[11]:0,85
Once, on a fact-finding tour through LA, I sat in the back of a reeducation lecture.
====
/html/body/div/p[11]:85,247
The trainees had all held lofty positions in the entertainment industry, a mélange of agents, managers, “creative executives,” whatever the hell that means.
====
/html/body/div/p[11]:247,299
I can understand their resistance, their arrogance.
====
/html/body/div/p[11]:299,383
Before the war, entertainment had been the most valued export of the United States.
====
/html/body/div/p[11]:383,475
Now they were being trained as custodians for a munitions plant in Bakersfield, California.
====
/html/body/div/p[11]:475,516
One woman, a casting director, exploded.
====
/html/body/div/p[11]:516,553
How dare they degrade her like this!
====
/html/body/div/p[11]:553,745
She had an MFA in Conceptual Theater, she had cast the top three grossing sitcoms in the last five seasons and she made more in a week than her instructor could dream of in several lifetimes!
====
/html/body/div/p[11]:745,800
She kept addressing that instructor by her first name.
====
/html/body/div/p[11]:800,856
“Magda,” she kept saying, “Magda, enough already.
====
/html/body/div/p[11]:856,980
Magda, please.” At first I thought this woman was just being rude, degrading the instructor by refusing to use her title.
====
/html/body/div/p[11]:980,1064
I found out later that Mrs. Magda Antonova used to be this woman’s cleaning lady.
====
/html/body/div/p[11]:1064,1239
Yes, it was very hard for some, but a lot of them later admitted that they got more emotional satisfaction from their new jobs than anything closely resembling their old ones.
====
/html/body/div/p[12]:0,65
I met one gentleman on a coastal ferry from Portland to Seattle.
====
/html/body/div/p[12]:65,231
He had worked in the licensing department for an advertising agency, specifically in charge of procuring the rights to classic rock songs for television commercials.
====
/html/body/div/p[12]:231,259
Now he was a chimney sweep.
====
/html/body/div/p[12]:259,384
Given that most homes in Seattle had lost their central heat and the winters were now longer and colder, he was seldom idle.
====
/html/body/div/p[12]:384,438
“I help keep my neighbors warm,” he said proudly.
====
/html/body/div/p[12]:438,528
I know it sounds a little too Norman Rockwell, but I hear stories like that all the time.
====
/html/body/div/p[12]:528,634
“You see those shoes, I made them,” “That sweater, that’s my sheep’s wool,” “Like the corn?
====
/html/body/div/p[12]:634,696
My garden.” That was the upshot of a more localized system.
====
/html/body/div/p[12]:696,930
It gave people the opportunity to see the fruits of their labor, it gave them a sense of individual pride to know they were making a clear, concrete contribution to victory, and it gave me a wonderful feeling that I was part of that.
====
/html/body/div/p[12]:930,953
I needed that feeling.
====
/html/body/div/p[12]:953,998
It kept me sane for the other part of my job.
====
/html/body/div/p[13]
So much for “talent.” “Tools” are the weapons of war, and the industrial and logistical means by which those weapons are constructed.

Ask anyone how the Allies won the Second World War.
====
/html/body/div/p[29]:52,138
Those with very little knowledge might answer that it was our numbers or generalship.
====
/html/body/div/p[29]:138,225
Those without any knowledge might point to techno-marvels like radar or the atom bomb.
====
/html/body/div/p[29]:225,658
[Scowls.] Anyone with the most rudimentary understanding of that conflict will give you three real reasons: first, the ability to manufacture more materiel: more bullets, beans, and bandages than the enemy; second, the natural resources available to manufacture that materiel; and third, the logistical means to not only transport those resources to the factories, but also to transport the finished products out to the front lines.
====
/html/body/div/p[29]:658,733
The Allies had the resources, industry, and logistics of an entire planet.
====
/html/body/div/p[29]:733,840
The Axis, on the other hand, had to depend on what scant assets they could scrape up within their borders.
====

This time we were the Axis.
====
/html/body/div/p[29]:868,1047
The living dead controlled most of the world’s landmass, while American war production depended on what could be harvested within the limits of the western states specifically.
====
/html/body/div/p[29]:1047,1205
Forget raw materials from safe zones overseas; our merchant fleet was crammed to the decks with refugees while fuel shortages had dry-docked most of our navy.

California’s agricultural base could at least erase the problem of starvation, if it could be restructured.

It was when the infestation hit the San Joaquin Valley, the dead swarming over his fences, attacking his cattle, tearing them apart like African driver ants.
====
/html/body/div/p[30]:511,614
And there he was in the middle of it all, shooting and hollering like Gregory Peck in Duel in the Sun.
====
/html/body/div/p[30]:614,652
I dealt with him openly and honestly.
====
/html/body/div/p[30]:652,698
As with everyone else, I gave him the choice.
====
/html/body/div/p[30]:698,796
I reminded him that winter was coming and there were still a lot of very hungry people out there.
====
/html/body/div/p[30]:796,950
I warned him that when the hordes of starving refugees showed up to finish what the living dead started, he’d have no government protection whatsoever.
====
/html/body/div/p[30]:950,1012
Hill was a brave, stubborn bastard, but he wasn’t an idiot.
====
/html/body/div/p[30]:1012,1141
He agreed to surrender his land and herd only on the condition that his and everyone else’s breeding stock remained untouched.
====
/html/body/div/p[30]:1141,1158
We shook on that.
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:0,99
Tender, juicy steaks—can you think of a better icon of our prewar artificial standard of living?
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:99,176
And yet it was that standard that ended up being our second great advantage.
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:176,236
The only way to supplement our resource base was recycling.
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:236,258
This was nothing new.
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:258,382
The Israelis had started when they sealed their borders and since then each nation had adopted it to one degree or another.
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:382,468
None of their stockpiles, however, could even compare to what we had at our disposal.
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:468,522
Think about what life was like in the prewar America.
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:522,682
Even those considered middle class enjoyed, or took for granted, a level of material comfort unheard of by any other nation at any other time in human history.
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:682,835
The clothing, the kitchenware, the electronics, the automobiles, just in the Los Angeles basin alone, outnumbered the prewar population by three to one.
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:835,904
The cars poured in by the millions, every house, every neighborhood.
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:904,1119
We had an entire industry of over a hundred thousand employees working three shifts, seven days a week: collecting, cataloging, disassembling, storing, and shipping parts and pieces to factories all over the coast.
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:1119,1267
There was a little trouble, like with the cattle ranchers, people not wanting to turn over their Hummers or vintage Italian midlife crisis mobiles.
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:1267,1324
Funny, no gas to run them but they still hung on anyway.
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:1324,1356
It didn’t bother me too much.
====
/html/body/div/p[31]:1356,1429
They were a pleasure to deal with compared to the military establishment.
====
/html/body/div/p[32]:0,75
Of all my adversaries, easily the most tenacious were the ones in uniform.
====
/html/body/div/p[32]:75,177
I never had direct control over any of their R&D, they were free to green light whatever they wanted.
====
/html/body/div/p[32]:177,354
But given that almost all their programs were farmed out to civilian contractors and that those contractors depended on resources controlled by DeStRes, I had de facto control.
====
/html/body/div/p[32]:354,418
“You cannot mothball our Stealth bombers,” they would yell.
====
/html/body/div/p[32]:418,568
“Who the Blank do you think you are to cancel our production of tanks?” At first I tried to reason with them: “The M-1 Abrams has a jet engine.
====
/html/body/div/p[32]:568,615
Where are you going to find that kind of fuel?
====
/html/body/div/p[32]:615,901
Why do you need Stealth aircraft against an enemy that doesn’t have radar?” I tried to make them see that given what we had to work with, as opposed to what we were facing, we simply had to get the largest return on our investment or, in their language, the most bang for our buck.
====
/html/body/div/p[32]:901,1004
They were insufferable, with their all-hours phone calls, or just showing up at my office unannounced.
====
/html/body/div/p[32]:1004,1182
I guess I can’t really blame them, not after how we all treated them after the last brushfire war, and certainly not after almost having their asses handed to them at Yonkers.
====
/html/body/div/p[32]:1182,1281
They were teetering on the edge of total collapse, and a lot of them just needed somewhere to vent.

[He grins confidently.]

====
/html/body/div/p[36]:0,121
I started my career trading on the floor of the NYSE, so I can yell as hard and long as any professional drill sergeant.
====
/html/body/div/p[36]:121,372
After each “meeting,” I’d expect the call, the one I’d been both dreading and hoping for: “Mister Sinclair, this is the president, I just want to thank you for your service and we’ll no longer be requiring…” [Chuckles.] It never came.
====
/html/body/div/p[36]:372,411
My guess is no one else wanted the job.
====
/html/body/div/p[37]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[38]
[His smile fades.]

/html/body/div/p[39]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[40]:0,48
I’m not saying that I didn’t make mistakes.
====
/html/body/div/p[40]:48,103
I know I was too anal about the air force’s D-Corps.
====
/html/body/div/p[40]:103,210
I didn’t understand their safety protocols or what dirigibles could really accomplish in undead warfare.
====
/html/body/div/p[40]:210,401
All I knew was that with our negligible helium supply, the only cost-effective lift gas was hydrogen and no way was I going to waste lives and resources on a fleet of modern-day Hindenburgs.
====
/html/body/div/p[40]:401,517
I also had to be persuaded, by the president, no less, to reopen the experimental cold fusion project at Livermore.
====
/html/body/div/p[40]:517,744
He argued that even though a breakthrough was, at best, still decades away, “planning for the future lets our people know there will be one.” I was too conservative with some projects, and with others I was far too liberal.
====
/html/body/div/p[41]:0,73
Project Yellow Jacket—I still kick myself when I think about that one.
====
/html/body/div/p[41]:73,273
These Silicon Valley eggheads, all of them geniuses in their own field, convinced me that they had a “wonder weapon” that could win the war, theoretically, within forty-eight hours of deployment.
====
/html/body/div/p[41]:273,486
They could build micro missiles, millions of them, about the size of a .22 rimfire bullet, that could be scattered from transport aircraft, then guided by satellites to the brain of every zombie in North America.
====
/html/body/div/p[41]:486,509
Sounds amazing, right?
====
/html/body/div/p[41]:509,522
It did to me.
====
/html/body/div/p[42]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[43]
[He grumbles to himself.]
====
/html/body/div/p[44]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[45]
When I think of what we poured down that hole, what we could have produced instead…ahhh…no point in dwelling on it now.
====
/html/body/div/p[46]:0,138
I could have gone head-to-head against the military for the duration of the war, but I’m grateful, in the end, that I didn’t have to.
====
/html/body/div/p[46]:138,302
When Travis D’Ambrosia became chairman of the Joint Chiefs, he not only invented the resource-to-kill ratio, but developed a comprehensive strategy to employ it.
====
/html/body/div/p[46]:302,379
I always listened to him when he told me a certain weapons system was vital.
====
/html/body/div/p[46]:379,477
I trusted his opinion in matters like the new Battle Dress Uniform or the Standard Infantry Rifle.
====
/html/body/div/p[47]:0,98
What was so amazing to see was how the culture of RKR began to take hold among the rank and file.
====
/html/body/div/p[47]:98,398
You’d hear soldiers talking on the street, in bars, on the train; “Why have X, when for the same price you could have ten Ys, which could kill a hundred times as many Zs.” Soldiers even began coming up with ideas on their own, inventing more cost-effective tools than we could have envisioned.
====
/html/body/div/p[47]:398,475
I think they enjoyed it—improvising, adapting, outthinking us bureaucrats.
====
/html/body/div/p[47]:475,510
The marines surprised me the most.
====
/html/body/div/p[47]:510,634
I’d always bought into the myth of the stupid jarhead, the knuckle-dragging, locked-jaw, testosterone-driven Neanderthal.
====
/html/body/div/p[47]:634,867
I never knew that because the Corps always has to procure its assets through the navy, and because admirals are never going to get too fired up about land warfare, that improvisation has had to be one of their most treasured virtues.
====

[Sinclair points above my head to the opposite wall.
====
/html/body/div/p[49]:53,158
On it hangs a heavy steel rod ending in what looks like a fusion of shovel and double-bladed battle-axe.
====
/html/body/div/p[49]:158,318
Its official designation is the Standard Infantry Entrenchment Tool, although, to most, it is known as either the “Lobotomizer,” or simply, the “Lobo.”]
====
/html/body/div/p[50]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[51]:0,86
The leathernecks came up with that one, using nothing but the steel of recycled cars.
====
/html/body/div/p[51]:86,130
We made twenty-three million during the war.
====
/html/body/div/p[52]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[53]
[He smiles with pride.]

And they’re still making them today.

BURLINGTON, VERMONT
====
/html/body/div/p[57]:0,83
[Winter has come later this season, as it has every year since the end of the war.
====
/html/body/div/p[57]:83,193
Snow blankets the house and surrounding farmland and frosts the trees that shade the dirt track by the river.
====
/html/body/div/p[57]:193,262
Everything about this scene is peaceful, except for the man with me.
====
/html/body/div/p[57]:262,488
He insists on calling himself “the Whacko,” because “everyone else calls me that, why shouldn’t you?” His stride is fast and purposeful, the cane given to him by his doctor (and wife) serves only to stab at the air.]
====
/html/body/div/p[58]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[59]:0,71
To be honest, I wasn’t surprised to be nominated for vice president.
====
/html/body/div/p[59]:71,119
Everyone knew a coalition party was inevitable.
====
/html/body/div/p[59]:119,226
I’d been a rising star, at least until I “self-destructed.” That’s what they said about me, right?
====
/html/body/div/p[59]:226,317
All the cowards and hypocrites who’d rather die than see a real man express his passion.
====
/html/body/div/p[59]:317,370
So what if I wasn’t the world’s best politician?
====
/html/body/div/p[59]:370,438
I said what I felt, and I wasn’t afraid to say it loud and clear.
====
/html/body/div/p[59]:438,509
That’s one of the main reasons I was the logical choice for copilot.
====
/html/body/div/p[59]:509,565
We made a great team; he was the light, I was the heat.
====
/html/body/div/p[59]:565,672
Different parties, different personalities, and, let’s not kid ourselves, different skin colors as well.
====
/html/body/div/p[59]:672,708
I knew I wasn’t the first choice.
====
/html/body/div/p[59]:708,745
I know who my party secretly wanted.
====
/html/body/div/p[59]:745,851
But America wasn’t ready to go that far, as stupid, ignorant, and infuriatingly Neolithic as it sounds.
====
/html/body/div/p[59]:851,983
They’d rather have a screaming radical for a VP than another one of “those people.” So I wasn’t surprised at my nomination.
====
/html/body/div/p[59]:983,1018
I was surprised at everything else.
====
/html/body/div/p[60]
You mean the elections?
====
/html/body/div/p[61]:0,11
Elections?
====
/html/body/div/p[61]:11,204
Honolulu was still a madhouse; soldiers, congressmen, refugees, all bumping into one another trying to find something to eat or a place to sleep or just to find out what the hell was going on.
====
/html/body/div/p[61]:204,248
And that was paradise next to the mainland.
====
/html/body/div/p[61]:248,329
The Rocky Line was just being established; everything west of it was a war zone.
====
/html/body/div/p[61]:329,445
Why go through all the trouble of elections when you could have Congress simply vote for extended emergency powers?
====
/html/body/div/p[61]:445,540
The attorney general had tried it when he was mayor of New York, almost got away with it, too.
====
/html/body/div/p[61]:540,663
I explained to the president that we didn’t have the energy or resources to do anything but fight for our very existence.
====
/html/body/div/p[62]
What did he say?
====
/html/body/div/p[63]
Well, let’s just say he convinced me otherwise.
====
/html/body/div/p[64]
Can you elaborate?
====
/html/body/div/p[65]:0,49
I could, but I don’t want to mangle his words.
====
/html/body/div/p[65]:49,99
The old neurons aren’t firing like they used to.
====
/html/body/div/p[66]
Please try.
====
/html/body/div/p[67]
You’ll fact-check with his library?
====
/html/body/div/p[68]
I promise.
====
/html/body/div/p[69]:0,81
Well…we were in his temporary office, the “presidential suite” of a hotel.
====
/html/body/div/p[69]:81,125
He’d just been sworn in on Air Force Two.
====
/html/body/div/p[69]:125,175
His old boss was sedated in the suite next to us.
====
/html/body/div/p[69]:175,397
From the window you could see the chaos on the streets, the ships at sea lining up to dock, the planes coming in every thirty seconds and ground crew pushing them off the runway once they landed to make room for new ones.
====
/html/body/div/p[69]:397,484
I was pointing to them, shouting and gesturing with the passion I’m most famous for.
====
/html/body/div/p[69]:484,540
“We need a stable government, fast!” I kept saying.
====
/html/body/div/p[69]:540,615
“Elections are great in principle but this is no time for high ideals.”
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:0,46
The president was cool, a lot cooler than me.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:46,187
Maybe it was all that military training…he said to me, “This is the only time for high ideals because those ideals are all that we have.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:187,282
We aren’t just fighting for our physical survival, but for the survival of our civilization.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:282,331
We don’t have the luxury of old-world pillars.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:331,406
We don’t have a common heritage, we don’t have a millennia of history.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:406,469
All we have are the dreams and promises that bind us together.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:469,576
All we have…[struggling to remember]…all we have is what we want to be.” You see what he was saying.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:576,741
Our country only exists because people believed in it, and if it wasn’t strong enough to protect us from this crisis, then what future could it ever hope to have?
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:741,824
He knew that America wanted a Caesar, but to be one would mean the end of America.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:824,861
They say great times make great men.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:861,879
I don’t buy it.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:879,920
I saw a lot of weakness, a lot of filth.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:920,1003
People who should have risen to the challenge and either couldn’t or wouldn’t.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:1003,1037
Greed, fear, stupidity, and hate.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:1037,1078
I saw it before the war, I see it today.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:1078,1103
My boss was a great man.
====
/html/body/div/p[70]:1103,1134
We were damn lucky to have him.
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:0,77
The business of elections really set the tone for his entire administration.
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:77,246
So many of his proposals looked crazy at first glance, but once you peeled back the first layer, you realized that underneath there existed a core of irrefutable logic.
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:246,301
Take the new punishment laws, those really set me off.
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:301,327
Putting people in stocks?
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:327,360
Whipping them in town squares!?!
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:360,415
What was this, Old Salem, the Taliban’s Afghanistan?
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:415,493
It sounded barbaric, un-American, until you really thought about the options.
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:493,565
What were you going to do with thieves and looters, put them in prison?
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:565,586
Who would that help?
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:586,689
Who could afford to divert able-bodied citizens to feed, clothe, and guard other able-bodied citizens?
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:689,796
More importantly, why remove the punished from society when they could serve as such a valuable deterrent?
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:796,910
Yes, there was the fear of pain—the lash, the cane—but all of that paled when compared to public humiliation.
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:910,964
People were terrified of having their crimes exposed.
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:964,1320
At a time when everyone was pulling together, helping each other out, working to protect and take care of one another, the worst thing you could do to someone was to march them up into the public square with a giant poster reading “I Stole My Neighbor’s Firewood.” Shame’s a powerful weapon, but it depended on everyone else doing the right thing.
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:1320,1485
No one is above the law, and seeing a senator given fifteen lashes for his involvement in war profiteering did more to curb crime than a cop on every street corner.
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:1485,1603
Yes, there were the work gangs, but those were the recidivists, those who’d been given chances time and time again.
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:1603,1789
I remember the attorney general suggesting that we dump as many of them into the infested zones as possible, rid ourselves of the drain and potential hazard of their continued presence.
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:1789,1888
Both the president and I opposed this proposition; my objections were ethical, his were practical.
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:1888,1985
We were still talking about American soil, infested yes, but, hopefully one day to be liberated.
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:1985,2354
“The last thing we needed,” he said “was to come up against one of these ex-cons as The New Grand Warlord of Duluth.” I thought he was joking, but later, as I saw the exact thing happen in other countries, as some exiled criminals rose to command their own isolated, and in some cases, powerful fiefdoms, I realized we’d dodged one hell of a speeding bullet.
====
/html/body/div/p[71]:2354,2526
The work gangs were always an issue for us, politically, socially, even economically, but what other choice did we have for those who just refused to play nice with others?
====
/html/body/div/p[72]
You did use the death penalty.
====
/html/body/div/p[73]:0,74
Only in extreme cases: sedition, sabotage, attempted political secession.
====
/html/body/div/p[73]:74,140
Zombies weren’t the only enemies, at least not in the beginning.
====
/html/body/div/p[74]
The Fundies?
====
/html/body/div/p[75]:0,70
We had our share of religious fundamentalists, what country didn’t?
====
/html/body/div/p[75]:70,149
Many of them believed that we were, in some way, interfering with God’s will.
====
/html/body/div/p[76]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[77]
[He chuckles.]
====
/html/body/div/p[78]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[79]
I’m sorry, I’ve gotta learn to be more sensitive, but for cryin’ out loud, you really think the supreme creator of the infinite multiverse is going to have his plans unraveled by a few Arizona National Guardsmen?
====
/html/body/div/p[80]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[81]
[He waves the thought away.]
====
/html/body/div/p[82]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:0,104
They got a lot more press than they should have, all because that nut-bird tried to kill the president.
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:104,313
In reality, they were much more a danger to themselves, all those mass suicides, the “mercy” child killings in Medford…terrible business, same with the “Greenies,” the leftie version of the Fundies.
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:313,464
They believed that since the living dead only consumed animals, but not plants, it was the will of the “Divine Goddess” to favor flora over fauna.
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:464,610
They made a little trouble, dumping herbicide in a town’s water supply, booby-trapping trees so loggers couldn’t use them for war production.
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:610,706
That kind of ecoterrorism eats up headlines but didn’t really threaten our national security.
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:706,777
The Rebs, on the other hand: armed, organized political secessionists.
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:777,819
That was easily our most tangible danger.
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:819,879
It was also the only time I ever saw the president worried.
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:879,945
He wouldn’t let on, not with that dignified, diplomatic veneer.
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:945,1035
In public, he treated it as just another “issue,” like food rationing or road repair.
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:1035,1211
He’d say in private…“They must be eliminated swiftly, decisively, and by any means necessary.” Of course, he was only talking about those within the western safe zone.
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:1211,1389
These diehard renegades either had some beef with the government’s wartime policy or had already planned to secede years before and were just using the crisis as their excuse.
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:1389,1519
These were the “enemies of our country,” the domestic ones anyone swearing to defend our country mentions in his or her oath.
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:1519,1590
We didn’t have to think twice about an appropriate response to them.
====
/html/body/div/p[83]:1590,1714
But the secessionists east of the Rockies, in some of the besieged, isolated zones…that’s when it got “complicated.”
====
/html/body/div/p[84]
Why is that?
====
/html/body/div/p[85]:0,59
Because, as the saying went, “We didn’t leave America.
====
/html/body/div/p[85]:59,113
America left us.” There’s a lot of truth to that.
====
/html/body/div/p[85]:113,139
We deserted those people.
====
/html/body/div/p[85]:139,290
Yes, we left some Special Forces volunteers, tried to supply them by sea and air, but from a purely moral standing, these people were truly abandoned.
====
/html/body/div/p[85]:290,361
I couldn’t blame them for wanting to go their own way, nobody could.
====
/html/body/div/p[85]:361,489
That’s why when we began to reclaim lost territory, we allowed every secessionist enclave a chance for peaceful reintegration.
====
/html/body/div/p[86]
But there was violence.
====
/html/body/div/p[87]:0,67
I still have nightmares, places like Bolivar, and the Black Hills.
====
/html/body/div/p[87]:67,134
I never see the actual images, not the violence, or the aftermath.
====
/html/body/div/p[87]:134,228
I always see my boss, this towering, powerful, vital man getting sicker and weaker each time.
====
/html/body/div/p[87]:228,288
He’d survived so much, shouldered such a crushing burden.
====
/html/body/div/p[87]:288,372
You know, he never tried to find out what had happened to his relatives in Jamaica?
====
/html/body/div/p[87]:372,390
Never even asked.
====
/html/body/div/p[87]:390,497
He was so fiercely focused on the fate of our nation, so determined to preserve the dream that created it.
====
/html/body/div/p[87]:497,573
I don’t know if great times make great men, but I know they can kill them.
====

WENATCHEE, WASHINGTON
====
/html/body/div/p[89]:0,54
[Joe Muhammad’s smile is as broad as his shoulders.
====
/html/body/div/p[89]:54,201
While his day job is as the owner of the town’s bicycle repair shop, his spare time is spent sculpting molten metal into exquisite works of art.
====
/html/body/div/p[89]:201,378
He is, no doubt, most famous for the bronze statue on the mall in Washington, D.C., the Neighborhood Security Memorial of two standing citizens, and one seated in a wheelchair.]
====
/html/body/div/p[90]:0,35
The recruiter was clearly nervous.
====
/html/body/div/p[90]:35,67
She tried to talk me out of it.
====
/html/body/div/p[90]:67,113
Had I spoken to the NRA representative first?
====
/html/body/div/p[90]:113,164
Did I know about all the other essential war work?
====
/html/body/div/p[90]:164,240
I didn’t understand at first; I already had a job at the recycling plant.
====
/html/body/div/p[90]:240,298
That was the point of Neighborhood Security Teams, right?
====
/html/body/div/p[90]:298,370
It was a part-time, volunteer service for when you were home from work.
====
/html/body/div/p[90]:370,402
I tried explaining this to her.
====
/html/body/div/p[90]:402,448
Maybe there was something I wasn’t getting.
====
/html/body/div/p[90]:448,539
As she tried some other half-hearted, half-assed excuses, I saw her eyes flick to my chair.
====
/html/body/div/p[91]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[92]
[Joe is disabled.]
====
/html/body/div/p[93]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:0,22
Can you believe that?
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:22,124
Here we were with mass extinction knocking on the door, and she’s trying to be politically correct?
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:124,135
I laughed.
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:135,164
I laughed right in her face.
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:164,242
What, did she think I just showed up without knowing what was expected of me?
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:242,297
Didn’t this dumb bitch read her own security manual?
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:297,318
Well, I’d read it.
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:318,472
The whole point of the NST program was to patrol your own neighborhood, walking, or, in my case, rolling down the sidewalk, stopping to check each house.
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:472,584
If, for some reason, you had to go inside, at least two members were always supposed to wait out in the street.
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:584,614
[Motions to himself.] Hell-o!
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:614,660
And what did she think we were facing anyway?
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:660,731
It’s not like we had to chase them over fences and across backyards.
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:731,748
They came to us.
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:748,858
And if and when they did so, let’s just say, for the sake of argument, there was more than we could handle?
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:858,957
Shit, if I couldn’t roll myself faster than a walking zombie, how could I have lasted this long?
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:957,1098
I stated my case very clearly and calmly, and I even challenged her to present a scenario in which my physical state could be an impediment.
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:1098,1114
She couldn’t.
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:1114,1207
There was some mumbling about having to check with her CO, maybe I could come back tomorrow.
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:1207,1356
I refused, told her she could call her CO, and his CO and everyone right up to the Bear 1 himself, but I wasn’t moving until I got my orange vest.
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:1356,1406
I yelled so loud everyone in the room could hear.
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:1406,1442
All eyes turned to me, then to her.
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:1442,1455
That did it.
====
/html/body/div/p[94]:1455,1523
I got my vest and was out of there faster than anyone else that day.
====
/html/body/div/p[95]:0,80
Like I said, Neighborhood Security literally means patrolling the neighborhood.
====
/html/body/div/p[95]:80,155
It’s a quasi-military outfit; we attended lectures and training courses.
====
/html/body/div/p[95]:155,280
There were designated leaders and fixed regulations, but you never had to salute or call people “sir” or shit like that.
====
/html/body/div/p[95]:280,323
Armament was pretty nonregulation as well.
====
/html/body/div/p[95]:323,424
Mostly hand-to-hand jobs—hatchets, bats, a few crowbars and machetes—we didn’t have Lobos yet.
====
/html/body/div/p[95]:424,477
At least three people in your team had to have guns.
====
/html/body/div/p[95]:477,547
I carried an AMT Lightning, this little semiauto .22-caliber carbine.
====
/html/body/div/p[95]:547,618
It had no kick so I could shoot without having to lock down my wheels.
====
/html/body/div/p[95]:618,702
Good gun, especially when ammo became standardized and reloads were still available.
====
/html/body/div/p[96]:0,42
Teams changed depending on your schedule.
====
/html/body/div/p[96]:42,108
It was pretty chaotic back then, DeStRes reorganizing everything.
====
/html/body/div/p[96]:108,138
Night shift was always tough.
====
/html/body/div/p[96]:138,200
You forget how dark the night really is without streetlights.
====
/html/body/div/p[96]:200,240
There were barely any houselights, too.
====
/html/body/div/p[96]:240,465
People went to bed pretty early back then, usually when it got dark, so except for a few candles or if someone had a license for a generator, like if they were doing essential war work from home, the houses were pitch-black.
====
/html/body/div/p[96]:465,552
You didn’t even have the moon or the stars anymore, too much crap in the atmosphere.
====
/html/body/div/p[96]:552,708
We patrolled with flashlights, basic civilian store-bought models; we still had batteries then, with red cellophane on the end to protect our night vision.
====
/html/body/div/p[96]:708,791
We’d stop at each house, knock, ask whoever was on watch if everything was okay.
====
/html/body/div/p[96]:791,869
The early months were a little unnerving because of the resettlement program.
====
/html/body/div/p[96]:869,992
So many people were coming out of the camps that each day you might get at least a dozen new neighbors, or even housemates.
====
/html/body/div/p[97]:0,99
I never realized how good we had it before the war, tucked away in my little Stepford suburbistan.
====
/html/body/div/p[97]:99,226
Did I really need a three-thousand-square-foot house, three bedrooms, two baths, a kitchen, living room, den, and home office?
====
/html/body/div/p[97]:226,387
I’d lived alone for years and suddenly I had a family from Alabama, six of them, just show up at my door one day with a letter from the Department of Housing.
====
/html/body/div/p[97]:387,446
It’s unnerving at first, but you get used to it quickly.
====
/html/body/div/p[97]:446,506
I didn’t mind the Shannons, that was the family’s name.
====
/html/body/div/p[97]:506,587
We got along pretty well, and I always slept better with someone standing watch.
====
/html/body/div/p[97]:587,637
That was one of the new rules for people at home.
====
/html/body/div/p[97]:637,686
Someone had to be the designated night watchman.
====
/html/body/div/p[97]:686,770
We had all their names on a list to make sure they weren’t squatters and looters.
====
/html/body/div/p[97]:770,843
We’d check their ID, their face, ask them if everything was all quiet.
====
/html/body/div/p[97]:843,921
They usually said yes, or maybe reported some noise we’d have to check out.
====
/html/body/div/p[97]:921,1058
By the second year, when the refugees stopped coming and everyone got to know each other, we didn’t bother with lists and IDs anymore.
====
/html/body/div/p[97]:1058,1086
Everything was calmer then.
====
/html/body/div/p[97]:1086,1190
That first year, when the cops were still re-forming and the safe zones weren’t completely pacified…
====
/html/body/div/p[98]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[99]
[Shivers for dramatic effect.]
====
/html/body/div/p[100]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[101]:0,115
There were still a lot of deserted houses, shot up or broken into or just abandoned with the doors left wide open.
====
/html/body/div/p[101]:115,171
We’d put police tape across all doorways and windows.
====
/html/body/div/p[101]:171,249
If any of them were found snapped, that could mean a zombie was in the house.
====
/html/body/div/p[101]:249,282
That happened a couple of times.
====
/html/body/div/p[101]:282,315
I’d wait outside, rifle ready.
====
/html/body/div/p[101]:315,363
Sometimes you’d hear shouts, sometimes shots.
====
/html/body/div/p[101]:363,499
Sometimes, you’d just hear a moan, scuffling, then one of your teammates would come out with a bloody hand weapon and a severed head.
====
/html/body/div/p[101]:499,531
I had to put a few down myself.
====
/html/body/div/p[101]:531,689
Sometimes, when the team was inside, and I was watching the street, I’d hear a noise, a shuffling, a rasping, something dragging itself through the bushes.
====
/html/body/div/p[101]:689,753
I’d hit it with the light, call for backup, then take it down.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:0,30
One time I almost got tagged.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:30,182
We were clearing a two-story job: four bed, four bath, partially collapsed from where someone had driven a Jeep Liberty through the living room window.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:182,238
My partner asked if it was cool to take a powder break.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:238,270
I let her go behind the bushes.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:270,278
My bad.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:278,355
I was too distracted, too concerned with what was going on inside the house.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:355,393
I didn’t notice what was behind me.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:393,434
Suddenly there was this tug on my chair.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:434,486
I tried to turn, but something had the right wheel.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:486,522
I twisted, brought my light around.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:522,579
It was a “dragger,” the kind that’s lost its legs.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:579,649
It snarled up at me from the asphalt, trying to climb over the wheel.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:649,674
The chair saved my life.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:674,744
It gave me the second and a half I needed to bring my carbine around.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:744,826
If I’d been standing, it might have grabbed my ankle, maybe even taken a chunk.
====
/html/body/div/p[102]:826,873
That was the last time I slacked off at my job.
====
/html/body/div/p[103]:0,66
Zombies weren’t the only problem we had to deal with back then.
====
/html/body/div/p[103]:66,161
There were looters, not so much hardened criminals as just people who needed stuff to survive.
====
/html/body/div/p[103]:161,213
Same with squatters; both cases usually ended well.
====
/html/body/div/p[103]:213,327
We’d just invite them home, give them what they needed, take care of them until the housing folks could step in.
====
/html/body/div/p[104]:0,61
There were some real looters, though, professional bad guys.
====
/html/body/div/p[104]:61,95
That was the only time I got hurt.
====
/html/body/div/p[105]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[106]
[He pulls down his shirt, exposing a circular scar the size of a prewar dime.]
====
/html/body/div/p[107]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[108]:0,45
Nine millimeter, right through the shoulder.
====
/html/body/div/p[108]:45,82
My team chased him out of the house.
====
/html/body/div/p[108]:82,105
I ordered him to halt.
====
/html/body/div/p[108]:105,162
That was the only time I ever killed someone, thank God.
====
/html/body/div/p[108]:162,240
When the new laws came in, conventional crime pretty much dried up altogether.
====
/html/body/div/p[109]:0,84
Then there were the ferals, you know, the homeless kids who’d lost their parents.
====
/html/body/div/p[109]:84,149
We’d find them curled up in basements, in closets, under beds.
====
/html/body/div/p[109]:149,205
A lot of them had walked from as far away as back east.
====
/html/body/div/p[109]:205,258
They were in bad shape, all malnourished and sickly.
====
/html/body/div/p[109]:258,287
A lot of times they’d run.
====
/html/body/div/p[109]:287,365
Those were the only times I felt bad, you know, that I couldn’t chase them.
====
/html/body/div/p[109]:365,437
Someone else would go, a lot of times they’d catch up, but not always.
====
/html/body/div/p[110]
The biggest problem were quislings.
====
/html/body/div/p[111]
Quislings?
====
/html/body/div/p[112]
Yeah, you know, the people that went nutballs and started acting like zombies.
====
/html/body/div/p[113]
Could you elaborate?
====
/html/body/div/p[114]
Well, I’m not a shrink, so I don’t know all the tech terms.
====
/html/body/div/p[115]
That’s all right.
====
/html/body/div/p[116]:0,106
Well, as I understand it, there’s a type of person who just can’t deal with a fight-or-die situation.
====
/html/body/div/p[116]:106,158
They’re always drawn to what they’re afraid of.
====
/html/body/div/p[116]:158,235
Instead of resisting it, they want to please it, join it, try to be like it.
====
/html/body/div/p[116]:235,421
I guess that happens in kidnap situations, you know, like a Patty Hearst/ Stockholm Syndrome–type, or, like in regular war, when people who are invaded sign up for the enemy’s army.
====
/html/body/div/p[116]:421,576
Collaborators, sometimes even more die-hard than the people they’re trying to mimic, like those French fascists who were some of Hitler’s last troops.
====
/html/body/div/p[116]:576,659
Maybe that’s why we call them quislings, like it’s a French word or something.
====
/html/body/div/p[116]:659,660
2
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:0,38
But you couldn’t do it in this war.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:38,188
You couldn’t just throw up your hands and say, “Hey, don’t kill me, I’m on your side.” There was no gray area in this fight, no in between.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:188,237
I guess some people just couldn’t accept that.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:237,270
It put them right over the edge.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:270,371
They started moving like zombies, sounding like them, even attacking and trying to eat other people.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:371,408
That’s how we found our first one.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:408,442
He was a male adult, midthirties.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:442,485
Dirty, dazed, shuffling down the sidewalk.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:485,561
We thought he was just in Z-shock, until he bit one of our guys in the arm.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:561,594
That was a horrible few seconds.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:594,661
I dropped the Q with a head shot then turned to check on my buddy.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:661,744
He was crumpled on the curb, swearing, crying, staring at the gash in his forearm.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:744,786
This was a death sentence and he knew it.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:786,897
He was ready to do himself until we discovered that the guy I shot had bright red blood pouring from his head.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:897,951
When we checked his flesh we found he was still warm!
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:951,991
You should have seen our buddy lose it.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:991,1065
It’s not every day you get a reprieve from the big governor in the sky.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:1065,1100
Ironically, he almost died anyway.
====
/html/body/div/p[117]:1100,1190
The bastard had so much bacteria in his mouth that it caused a near fatal staph infection.
====
/html/body/div/p[118]:0,106
We thought maybe we stumbled onto some new discovery but it turned out it’d been happening for a while.
====
/html/body/div/p[118]:106,143
The CDC was just about to go public.
====
/html/body/div/p[118]:143,242
They even sent an expert up from Oakland to brief us on what to do if we encountered more of them.
====
/html/body/div/p[118]:242,261
It blew our minds.
====
/html/body/div/p[118]:261,349
Did you know that quislings were the reason some people used to think they were immune?
====
/html/body/div/p[118]:349,425
They were also the reason all those bullshit wonder drugs got so much hype.
====
/html/body/div/p[118]:425,441
Think about it.
====
/html/body/div/p[118]:441,488
Someone’s on Phalanx, gets bit but survives.
====
/html/body/div/p[118]:488,520
What else is he going to think?
====
/html/body/div/p[118]:520,590
He probably wouldn’t know there was even such a thing as quislings.
====
/html/body/div/p[118]:590,673
They’re just as hostile as regular zombies and in some cases even more dangerous.
====
/html/body/div/p[119]
How so?
====
/html/body/div/p[120]:0,43
Well, for one thing, they didn’t freeze.
====
/html/body/div/p[120]:43,191
I mean, yeah, they would if they were exposed over time, but in moderate cold, if they’d gone under while wearing warm clothes, they’d be fine.
====
/html/body/div/p[120]:191,240
They also got stronger from the people they ate.
====
/html/body/div/p[120]:240,258
Not like zombies.
====
/html/body/div/p[120]:258,288
They could maintain over time.
====
/html/body/div/p[121]
But you could kill them more easily.
====
/html/body/div/p[122]:0,12
Yes and no.
====
/html/body/div/p[122]:12,151
You didn’t have to hit them in head; you could take out the lungs, the heart, hit them anywhere, and eventually they’d bleed to death.
====
/html/body/div/p[122]:151,238
But if you didn’t stop them with one shot, they’d just keep coming until they died.
====
/html/body/div/p[123]
They don’t feel pain?
====
/html/body/div/p[124]:0,9
Hell no.
====
/html/body/div/p[124]:9,128
It’s that whole mind-over-matter thing, being so focused you’re able to suppress relays to the brain and all that.
====
/html/body/div/p[124]:128,164
You should really talk to an expert.
====
/html/body/div/p[125]
Please continue.
====
/html/body/div/p[126]:0,56
Okay, well, that’s why we could never talk them down.
====
/html/body/div/p[126]:56,91
There was nothing left to talk to.
====
/html/body/div/p[126]:91,188
These people were zombies, maybe not physically, but mentally you could not tell the difference.
====
/html/body/div/p[126]:188,281
Even physically it might be hard, if they were dirty enough, bloody enough, diseased enough.
====
/html/body/div/p[126]:281,365
Zombies don’t really smell that bad, not individually and not if they’re fresh.
====
/html/body/div/p[126]:365,441
How do you tell one of these from a mimic with a whopping dose of gangrene?
====
/html/body/div/p[126]:441,457
You couldn’t.
====
/html/body/div/p[126]:457,530
It’s not like the military would let us have sniffer dogs or anything.
====
/html/body/div/p[126]:530,558
You had to use the eye test.
====
/html/body/div/p[127]:0,42
Ghouls don’t blink, I don’t know why.
====
/html/body/div/p[127]:42,129
Maybe because they use their senses equally, their brains don’t value sight as much.
====
/html/body/div/p[127]:129,227
Maybe because they don’t have as much bodily fluid they can’t keep using it to coat the eyes.
====
/html/body/div/p[127]:227,279
Who knows, but they don’t blink and quislings do.
====
/html/body/div/p[127]:279,355
That’s how you spotted them; back up a few paces, and wait a few seconds.
====
/html/body/div/p[127]:355,414
Darkness was easier, you just shone a beam in their faces.
====
/html/body/div/p[127]:414,457
If they didn’t blink, you took them down.
====
/html/body/div/p[128]
And if they did?
====
/html/body/div/p[129]:0,99
Well, our orders were to capture quislings if possible, and use deadly force only in self-defense.
====
/html/body/div/p[129]:99,215
It sounded crazy, still does, but we rounded up a few, hog-tied them, turned them over to police or National Guard.
====
/html/body/div/p[129]:215,255
I’m not sure what they did with them.
====
/html/body/div/p[129]:255,390
I’ve heard stories about Walla Walla, you know, the prison where hundreds of them were fed and clothed and even medically cared for.
====
/html/body/div/p[129]:390,422
[His eyes flick to the ceiling.]
====
/html/body/div/p[130]
You don’t agree.
====
/html/body/div/p[131]:0,28
Hey, I’m not going there.
====
/html/body/div/p[131]:28,81
You want to open that can of worms, read the papers.
====
/html/body/div/p[131]:81,188
Every year some lawyer or priest or politician tries to stoke that fire for whatever side best suits them.
====
/html/body/div/p[131]:188,216
Personally, I don’t care.
====
/html/body/div/p[131]:216,278
I don’t have any feelings toward them one way or the other.
====
/html/body/div/p[131]:278,371
I think the saddest thing about them is that they gave up so much and in the end lost anyway.
====
/html/body/div/p[132]
Why is that?
====
/html/body/div/p[133]:0,88
’Cause even though we can’t tell the difference between them, the real zombies can.
====
/html/body/div/p[133]:88,203
Remember early in the war, when everybody was trying to work on a way to turn the living dead against one another?
====
/html/body/div/p[133]:203,334
There was all this “documented proof” about infighting—eyewitness accounts and even footage of one zombie attacking another.
====
/html/body/div/p[133]:334,342
Stupid.
====
/html/body/div/p[133]:342,429
It was zombies attacking quislings, but you never would have known that to look at it.
====
/html/body/div/p[133]:429,455
Quislings don’t scream.
====
/html/body/div/p[133]:455,595
They just lie there, not even trying to fight, writhing in that slow, robotic way, eaten alive by the very creatures they’re trying to be.
====
/html/body/div/p[134]
MALIBU, CALIFORNIA
====
/html/body/div/p[135]:0,54
[I don’t need a photograph to recognize Roy Elliot.
====
/html/body/div/p[135]:54,111
We meet for coffee on the restored Malibu Pier Fortress.
====
/html/body/div/p[135]:111,210
Those around us also instantly recognize him, but, unlike prewar days, keep a respectful distance.]
====
/html/body/div/p[136]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:0,126
ADS, that was my enemy: Asymptomatic Demise Syndrome, or, Apocalyptic Despair Syndrome, depending on who you were talking to.
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:126,264
Whatever the label, it killed as many people in those early stalemate months as hunger, disease, interhuman violence, or the living dead.
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:264,311
No one understood what was happening at first.
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:311,441
We’d stabilized the Rockies, we’d sanitized the safe zones, and still we were losing upwards of a hundred or so people a day.
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:441,486
It wasn’t suicide, we had plenty of those.
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:486,510
No, this was different.
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:510,600
Some people had minimal wounds or easily treatable ailments; some were in perfect health.
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:600,674
They would simply go to sleep one night and not wake up the next morning.
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:674,812
The problem was psychological, a case of just giving up, not wanting to see tomorrow because you knew it could only bring more suffering.
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:812,870
Losing faith, the will to endure, it happens in all wars.
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:870,924
It happens in peacetime, too, just not on this scale.
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:924,990
It was helplessness, or at least, the perception of helplessness.
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:990,1017
I understood that feeling.
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:1017,1054
I directed movies all my adult life.
====
/html/body/div/p[137]:1054,1153
They called me the boy genius, the wunderkind who couldn’t fail, even though I’d done so often.
====
/html/body/div/p[138]:0,33
Suddenly I was a nobody, an F-6.
====
/html/body/div/p[138]:33,115
The world was going to hell and all my vaunted talents were powerless to stop it.
====
/html/body/div/p[138]:115,234
When I heard about ADS, the government was trying to keep it quiet—I had to find out from a contact at Cedars-Sinai.
====
/html/body/div/p[138]:234,276
When I heard about it, something snapped.
====
/html/body/div/p[138]:276,352
Like the time I made my first Super 8 short and screened it for my parents.
====
/html/body/div/p[138]:352,379
This I can do, I realized.
====
/html/body/div/p[138]:379,402
This enemy I can fight!
====
/html/body/div/p[139]
And the rest is history.
====
/html/body/div/p[140]:0,18
[Laughs.] I wish.
====
/html/body/div/p[140]:18,73
I went straight to the government, they turned me down.
====
/html/body/div/p[141]:0,8
Really?
====
/html/body/div/p[141]:8,43
I would think, given your career…
====
/html/body/div/p[142]:0,13
What career?
====
/html/body/div/p[142]:13,68
They wanted soldiers and farmers, real jobs, remember?
====
/html/body/div/p[142]:68,175
It was like “Hey, sorry, no dice, but can I get your autograph?” Now, I’m not the surrendering type.
====
/html/body/div/p[142]:175,250
When I believe in my ability to do something, there is no such word as no.
====
/html/body/div/p[142]:250,323
I explained to the DeStRes rep that it wouldn’t cost Uncle Sam a dime.
====
/html/body/div/p[142]:323,419
I’d use my own equipment, my own people, all I’d need from them was access to the military.
====
/html/body/div/p[142]:419,494
“Let me show the people what you’re doing to stop this,” I told him.
====
/html/body/div/p[142]:494,564
“Let me give them something to believe in.” Again, I was refused.
====
/html/body/div/p[142]:564,648
The military had more important missions right now than “posing for the camera.”
====
/html/body/div/p[143]
Did you go over his head?
====
/html/body/div/p[144]:0,8
To who?
====
/html/body/div/p[144]:8,90
There were no boats to Hawaii and Sinclair was racing up and down the West Coast.
====
/html/body/div/p[144]:90,212
Anybody in any position to help was either physically unavailable or far too distracted with more “important” matters.
====
/html/body/div/p[145]
Couldn’t you have become a freelance journalist, gotten a government press pass?
====
/html/body/div/p[146]:0,30
It would have taken too long.
====
/html/body/div/p[146]:30,85
Most mass media was either knocked out or federalized.
====
/html/body/div/p[146]:85,205
What was left had to rebroadcast public safety announcements, to make sure anyone just tuning in would know what to do.
====
/html/body/div/p[146]:205,239
Everything was still such a mess.
====
/html/body/div/p[146]:239,335
We barely had passable roads, let alone the bureaucracy to give me full-time journalist status.
====
/html/body/div/p[146]:335,363
It might have taken months.
====
/html/body/div/p[146]:363,403
Months, with a hundred dying every day.
====
/html/body/div/p[146]:403,422
I couldn’t wait.
====
/html/body/div/p[146]:422,457
I had to do something immediately.
====
/html/body/div/p[146]:457,525
I took a DV cam, some spare batteries, and a solar-powered charger.
====
/html/body/div/p[146]:525,685
My oldest son came with me as my sound man and “first AD.” We traveled on the road for one week, just the two of us on mountain bikes, looking for stories.
====
/html/body/div/p[146]:685,712
We didn’t have to go far.
====
/html/body/div/p[147]:0,146
Just outside of Greater Los Angeles, in a town called Claremont, are five colleges—Pomona, Pitzer, Scripps, Harvey Mudd, and Claremont Mckenna.
====
/html/body/div/p[147]:146,283
At the start of the Great Panic, when everyone else was running, literally, for the hills, three hundred students chose to make a stand.
====
/html/body/div/p[147]:283,371
They turned the Women’s College at Scripps into something resembling a medieval city.
====
/html/body/div/p[147]:371,492
They got their supplies from the other campuses; their weapons were a mix of landscaping tools and ROTC practice rifles.
====
/html/body/div/p[147]:492,561
They planted gardens, dug wells, fortified an already existing wall.
====
/html/body/div/p[147]:561,710
While the mountains burned behind them, and the surrounding suburbs descended into violence, those three hundred kids held off ten thousand zombies!
====
/html/body/div/p[147]:710,807
Ten thousand, over the course of four months, until the Inland Empire could finally be pacified.
====
/html/body/div/p[147]:807,1030
1 We were lucky to get there just at the tail end, just in time to see the last of the undead fall, as cheering students and soldiers linked up under the oversized, homemade Old Glory fluttering from the Pomona bell tower.
====
/html/body/div/p[147]:1030,1044
What a story!
====
/html/body/div/p[147]:1044,1088
Ninety-six hours of raw footage in the can.
====
/html/body/div/p[147]:1088,1151
I would have liked to have gone longer, but time was critical.
====
/html/body/div/p[147]:1151,1184
One hundred a day lost, remember.
====
/html/body/div/p[148]:0,54
We had to get this one out there as soon as possible.
====
/html/body/div/p[148]:54,126
I brought the footage back to my house, cut it together in my edit bay.
====
/html/body/div/p[148]:126,153
My wife did the narration.
====
/html/body/div/p[148]:153,287
We made fourteen copies, all on different formats, and screened them that Saturday night at different camps and shelters all over LA.
====
/html/body/div/p[148]:287,350
I called it Victory at Avalon: The Battle of the Five Colleges.
====
/html/body/div/p[149]:0,95
The name, Avalon, comes from some stock footage one of the students had shot during the siege.
====
/html/body/div/p[149]:95,214
It was the night before their last, worst attack, when a fresh horde from the east was clearly visible on the horizon.
====
/html/body/div/p[149]:214,325
The kids were hard at work—sharpening weapons, reinforcing defenses, standing guard on the walls and towers.
====
/html/body/div/p[149]:325,431
A song came floating across the campus from the loudspeaker that played constant music to keep morale up.
====
/html/body/div/p[149]:431,511
A Scripps student, with a voice like an angel, was singing the Roxy Music song.
====
/html/body/div/p[149]:511,602
It was such a beautiful rendition, and such a contrast with the raging storm about to hit.
====
/html/body/div/p[149]:602,656
I laid it over my “preparing for battle” montage.
====
/html/body/div/p[149]:656,693
I still get choked up when I hear it.
====
/html/body/div/p[150]
How did it play with the audience?
====
/html/body/div/p[151]:0,11
It bombed!
====
/html/body/div/p[151]:11,87
Not just the scene, but the whole movie; at least, that’s what I thought.
====
/html/body/div/p[151]:87,129
I’d expected a more immediate reaction.
====
/html/body/div/p[151]:129,149
Cheering, applause.
====
/html/body/div/p[151]:149,386
I would never have admitted this to anyone, even to myself, but I had this egotistical fantasy of people coming up to me afterward, tears in their eyes, grabbing my hands, thanking me for showing them the light at the end of the tunnel.
====
/html/body/div/p[151]:386,417
They didn’t even look at me.
====
/html/body/div/p[151]:417,467
I stood by the doorway like some conquering hero.
====
/html/body/div/p[151]:467,529
They just filed past silently with their eyes on their shoes.
====
/html/body/div/p[151]:529,658
I went home that night thinking, “Oh well, it was a nice idea, maybe the potato farm in MacArthur Park can use another hand.”
====
/html/body/div/p[152]
What happened?
====
/html/body/div/p[153]:0,19
Two weeks went by.
====
/html/body/div/p[153]:19,83
I got a real job, helping to reopen the road at Topanga Canyon.
====
/html/body/div/p[153]:83,123
Then one day a man rode up to my house.
====
/html/body/div/p[153]:123,178
Just came in on horseback as if out of an old Cecil B.
====
/html/body/div/p[153]:178,196
De Mille western.
====
/html/body/div/p[153]:196,268
He was a psychiatrist from the county health facility in Santa Barbara.
====
/html/body/div/p[153]:268,349
They’d heard about the success of my movie and asked if I had any extra copies.
====
/html/body/div/p[154]
Success?
====
/html/body/div/p[155]:0,22
That’s what I said.
====
/html/body/div/p[155]:22,135
As it turns out, the very night after Avalon made its “debut,” ADS cases dropped in LA by a whole 5 percent!
====
/html/body/div/p[155]:135,321
At first they thought it might just be a statistical anomaly, until a further study revealed that the decline was drastically noticeable only among communities where the movie was shown!
====
/html/body/div/p[156]
And no one told you?
====
/html/body/div/p[157]:0,8
No one.
====
/html/body/div/p[157]:8,169
[Laughs.] Not the military, not the municipal authorities, not even the people who ran the shelters where it was continuing to be screened without my knowledge.
====
/html/body/div/p[157]:169,185
I don’t care.
====
/html/body/div/p[157]:185,209
The point is it worked.
====
/html/body/div/p[157]:209,277
It made a difference, and it gave me a job for the rest of the war.
====
/html/body/div/p[157]:277,350
I got a few volunteers together, as much of my old crew as I could find.
====
/html/body/div/p[157]:350,454
That kid who shot the Claremont stock footage, Malcolm Van Ryzin, yes, that Malcolm, 2 he became my DP.
====
/html/body/div/p[157]:454,564
3 We commandeered an abandoned dubbing house in West Hollywood and started cranking them out by the hundreds.
====
/html/body/div/p[157]:564,646
We’d put them on every train, every caravan, every coastal ferry heading north.
====
/html/body/div/p[157]:646,680
It took a while to get responses.
====
/html/body/div/p[157]:680,701
But when they came…
====
/html/body/div/p[158]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[159]
[He smiles, holds his hands up in thanks.]
====
/html/body/div/p[160]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[161]:0,58
Ten percent drop throughout the entire western safe zone.
====
/html/body/div/p[161]:58,116
I was already on the road by then, shooting more stories.
====
/html/body/div/p[161]:116,191
Anacapa was already wrapped, and we were halfway through Mission District.
====
/html/body/div/p[161]:191,317
By the time Dos Palmos hit screens, and ADS was down 23 percent…only then did the government finally take an interest in me.
====
/html/body/div/p[162]
Additional resources?
====
/html/body/div/p[163]:0,14
[Laughs.] No.
====
/html/body/div/p[163]:14,83
I’d never asked for help and they sure weren’t going to give it.
====
/html/body/div/p[163]:83,165
But I did finally get access to the military and that opened up a whole new world.
====
/html/body/div/p[164]
Is that when you made Fire of the Gods?
====
/html/body/div/p[165]:0,77
[Nods.] The army had two functioning laser weapons programs: Zeus and MTHEL.
====
/html/body/div/p[165]:77,171
Zeus was originally designed for munitions clearing, zapping land mines and unexploded bombs.
====
/html/body/div/p[165]:171,240
It was small and light enough to be mounted in a specialized Humvee.
====
/html/body/div/p[165]:240,308
The gunner sighted a target through a coaxial camera in the turret.
====
/html/body/div/p[165]:308,416
He placed the aim point on the intended surface, then fired a pulse beam through the same optical aperture.
====
/html/body/div/p[165]:416,438
Is that too technical?
====
/html/body/div/p[166]
Not at all.
====
/html/body/div/p[167]:0,13
I’m sorry.
====
/html/body/div/p[167]:13,57
I became extremely immersed in the project.
====
/html/body/div/p[167]:57,167
The beam was a weaponized version of solid-state, industrial lasers, the kind used to cut steel in factories.
====
/html/body/div/p[167]:167,280
It could either burn through a bomb’s outer casing or heat it to a point that detonated the explosive package.
====
/html/body/div/p[167]:280,319
The same principle worked for zombies.
====
/html/body/div/p[167]:319,380
On higher settings it punched right through their foreheads.
====
/html/body/div/p[167]:380,482
On lower settings, it literally boiled their brain till it exploded through the ears, nose, and eyes.
====
/html/body/div/p[167]:482,552
The footage we shot was dazzling, but Zeus was a popgun next to MTHEL.
====
/html/body/div/p[168]:0,141
The acronym stands for Mobile Tactical High Energy Laser, codesigned by the United States and Israel to take out small incoming projectiles.
====
/html/body/div/p[168]:141,312
When Israel declared self-quarantine, and when so many terrorist groups were lobbing mortar rounds and rockets across the security wall, MTHEL was what knocked them down.
====
/html/body/div/p[168]:312,462
About the size and shape of a World War II searchlight, it was, in fact, a deuterium fluoride laser, much more powerful than the solid state on Zeus.
====
/html/body/div/p[168]:462,492
The effects were devastating.
====
/html/body/div/p[168]:492,572
It blasted flesh from bones that then heated white before shattering into dust.
====
/html/body/div/p[168]:572,655
When played at regular speed, it was magnificent, but at slo-mo…fire of the gods.
====
/html/body/div/p[169]
Is it true that the number of ADS cases were halved a month after the movie’s release?
====
/html/body/div/p[170]:0,85
I think that might be an overstatement, but people were lined up on their off-hours.
====
/html/body/div/p[170]:85,110
Some saw it every night.
====
/html/body/div/p[170]:110,176
The poster campaign showed a close-up of a zombie being atomized.
====
/html/body/div/p[170]:176,310
The image was lifted right from a frame in the movie, the one classic shot when the morning fog actually allowed you to see the beam.
====
/html/body/div/p[170]:310,394
The caption underneath read simply “Next.” It single-handedly saved the program.
====
/html/body/div/p[171]
Your program.
====
/html/body/div/p[172]
No, Zeus and MTHEL.
====
/html/body/div/p[173]
They were in jeopardy?
====
/html/body/div/p[174]:0,47
MTHEL was due to close a month after shooting.
====
/html/body/div/p[174]:47,78
Zeus had already been chopped.
====
/html/body/div/p[174]:78,167
We had to beg, borrow, and steal, literally, to get it reactivated just for our cameras.
====
/html/body/div/p[174]:167,221
DeStRes had deemed both as a gross waste of resources.
====
/html/body/div/p[175]
Were they?
====
/html/body/div/p[176]:0,16
Inexcusably so.
====
/html/body/div/p[176]:16,200
The “M” in MTHEL’s “Mobile” really meant a convoy of specialized vehicles, all of which were delicate, none truly all-terrain and each one completely dependent on the other.
====
/html/body/div/p[176]:200,330
MTHEL also required both tremendous power and copious amounts of highly unstable, highly toxic chemicals for the lasering process.

/html/body/div/p[177]:0,35
Zeus was a little more economical.
====
/html/body/div/p[177]:35,149
It was easier to cool, easier to maintain, and because it was Humvee-mounted, it could go anywhere it was needed.
====
/html/body/div/p[177]:149,190
The problem was, why would it be needed?
====
/html/body/div/p[177]:190,307
Even on high power, the gunner still had to hold a beam in place, on a moving target, mind you, for several seconds.
====
/html/body/div/p[177]:307,389
A good sharpshooter could get the job done in half the time with twice the kills.
====
/html/body/div/p[177]:389,483
That erased the potential for rapid fire, which was exactly what you needed in swarm attacks.
====
/html/body/div/p[177]:483,620
In fact, both units had a squad of riflemen permanently assigned to them, people protecting a machine that is designed to protect people.
====
/html/body/div/p[178]
They were that bad?
====
/html/body/div/p[179]:0,29
Not for their original role.
====
/html/body/div/p[179]:29,179
MTHEL kept Israel safe from terrorist bombardment, and Zeus actually came out of retirement to clear unexploded ordnance during the army’s advance.
====
/html/body/div/p[179]:179,228
As purpose-built weapons, they were outstanding.
====
/html/body/div/p[179]:228,271
As zombie killers, they were hopeless duds.
====
/html/body/div/p[180]
So why did you film them?
====
/html/body/div/p[181]:0,38
Because Americans worship technology.
====
/html/body/div/p[181]:38,90
It’s an inherent trait in the national zeitgeist.
====
/html/body/div/p[181]:90,200
Whether we realize it or not, even the most indefatigable Luddite can’t deny our country’s technoprowess.
====
/html/body/div/p[181]:200,367
We split the atom, we reached the moon, we’ve filled every household and business with more gadgets and gizmos than early sci-fi writers could have ever dreamed of.
====
/html/body/div/p[181]:367,436
I don’t know if that’s a good thing, I’m in no place to judge.
====
/html/body/div/p[181]:436,570
But I do know that just like all those ex-atheists in foxholes, most Americans were still praying for the God of science to save them.
====
/html/body/div/p[182]
But it didn’t.
====
/html/body/div/p[183]:0,24
But it didn’t matter.
====
/html/body/div/p[183]:24,88
The movie was such a hit that I was asked to do a whole series.
====
/html/body/div/p[183]:88,272
I called it “Wonder Weapons,” seven films on our military’s cutting-edge technology, none of which made any strategic difference, but all of which were psychological war winners.
====
/html/body/div/p[184]
Isn’t that…
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:0,7
A lie?
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:7,20
It’s okay.
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:20,36
You can say it.
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:36,96
Yes, they were lies and sometimes that’s not a bad thing.
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:96,127
Lies are neither bad nor good.
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:127,224
Like a fire they can either keep you warm or burn you to death, depending on how they’re used.
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:224,419
The lies our government told us before the war, the ones that were supposed to keep us happy and blind, those were the ones that burned, because they prevented us from doing what had to be done.
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:419,528
However, by the time I made Avalon, everyone was already doing everything they could possibly do to survive.
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:528,684
The lies of the past were long gone and now the truth was everywhere, shambling down their streets, crashing through their doors, clawing at their throats.
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:684,805
The truth was that no matter what we did, chances were most of us, if not all of us, were never going to see the future.
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:805,953
The truth was that we were standing at what might be the twilight of our species and that truth was freezing a hundred people to death every night.
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:953,994
They needed something to keep them warm.
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:994,1103
And so I lied, and so did the president, and every doctor and priest, every platoon leader and every parent.
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:1103,1157
“We’re going to be okay.” That was our message.
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:1157,1219
That was the message of every other filmmaker during the war.
====
/html/body/div/p[185]:1219,1254
Did you ever hear of The Hero City?
====
/html/body/div/p[186]
Of course.
====
/html/body/div/p[187]:0,19
Great film, right?
====
/html/body/div/p[187]:19,63
Marty made it over the course of the Siege.
====
/html/body/div/p[187]:63,128
Just him, shooting on whatever medium he could get his hands on.
====
/html/body/div/p[187]:128,224
What a masterpiece: the courage, the determination, the strength, dignity, kindness, and honor.
====
/html/body/div/p[187]:224,271
It really makes you believe in the human race.
====
/html/body/div/p[187]:271,317
It’s better than anything I’ve ever done.
====
/html/body/div/p[187]:317,335
You should see it.
====
/html/body/div/p[188]
I have.
====
/html/body/div/p[189]
Which version?
====
/html/body/div/p[190]
I’m sorry?
====
/html/body/div/p[191]
Which version did you see?
====
/html/body/div/p[192]
I wasn’t aware…
====
/html/body/div/p[193]:0,21
That there were two?
====
/html/body/div/p[193]:21,62
You need to do some homework, young man.
====
/html/body/div/p[193]:62,126
Marty made both a wartime and postwar version of The Hero City.
====
/html/body/div/p[193]:126,169
The version you saw, it was ninety minutes?
====
/html/body/div/p[194]
I think.
====
/html/body/div/p[195]:0,58
Did it show the dark side of the heroes in The Hero City?
====
/html/body/div/p[195]:58,190
Did it show the violence and the betrayal, the cruelty, the depravity, the bottomless evil in some of those “heroes’” hearts?
====
/html/body/div/p[195]:190,209
No, of course not.
====
/html/body/div/p[195]:209,223
Why would it?
====
/html/body/div/p[195]:223,357
That was our reality and it’s what drove so many people to get snuggled in bed, blow out their candles, and take their last breath.
====
/html/body/div/p[195]:357,578
Marty chose, instead, to show the other side, the one that gets people out of bed the next morning, makes them scratch and scrape and fight for their lives because someone is telling them that they’re going to be okay.
====
/html/body/div/p[195]:578,617
There’s a word for that kind of lie.
====
/html/body/div/p[195]:617,622
Hope.

As much a legend for her temper as for her outstanding war record, it is difficult to see how so much intensity can be compacted into her diminutive, almost childlike frame.
====
/html/body/div/p[197]:269,364
Her long black bangs and delicate facial features only reinforce the picture of eternal youth.

/html/body/div/p[199]:0,34
I was a Raptor driver, the FA-22.
====
/html/body/div/p[199]:34,100
It was, hands down, the best air superiority platform ever built.
====
/html/body/div/p[199]:100,153
It could outfly and outfight God and all his angels.
====
/html/body/div/p[199]:153,250
It was a monument to American technical prowess…and in this war, that prowess counted for shit.
====
/html/body/div/p[200]
That must have been frustrating.
====
/html/body/div/p[201]:0,13
Frustrating?
====
/html/body/div/p[201]:13,268
Do you know what it feels like to suddenly be told that the one goal you’ve worked toward your whole life, that you’ve sacrificed and suffered for, that’s pushed you beyond limits you never knew you had is now considered “strategically invalid”?
====
/html/body/div/p[202]
Would you say this was a common feeling?
====
/html/body/div/p[203]:0,108
Let me put it this way; the Russian army wasn’t the only service to be decimated by their own government.
====
/html/body/div/p[203]:108,178
The Armed Forces Reconstruction Act basically neutered the air force.
====
/html/body/div/p[203]:178,304
Some DeStRes “experts” had determined that our resource-to-kill ratio, our RKR, was the most lopsided of all the branches.
====
/html/body/div/p[204]
Could you give me some example?
====
/html/body/div/p[205]:0,47
How about the JSOW, the Joint Standoff Weapon?
====
/html/body/div/p[205]:47,158
It was a gravity bomb, guided by GPS and Inertial Nav, that could be released from as far as forty miles away.
====
/html/body/div/p[205]:158,390
The baseline version carried one hundred and forty BLU-97B submunitions, and each bomblet carried a shaped charge against armored targets, a fragmented case against infantry, and a zirconium ring to set the entire kill zone ablaze.
====
/html/body/div/p[205]:390,439
It had been considered a triumph, until Yonkers.
====
/html/body/div/p[205]:439,703
1 Now we were told that the price of one JSOW kit—the materials, manpower, time, and energy, not to mention the fuel and ground maintenance needed for the delivery aircraft—could pay for a platoon of infantry pukes who could smoke a thousand times as many Gs.
====
/html/body/div/p[205]:703,774
Not enough bang for our buck, like so many of our former crown jewels.
====
/html/body/div/p[205]:774,821
They went through us like an industrial laser.
====
/html/body/div/p[205]:821,924
The B-2 Spirits, gone; the B-1 Lancers, gone; even the old BUFFs, the B-52 Big Ugly Fat Fellows, gone.
====
/html/body/div/p[205]:924,1120
Throw in the Eagles, the Falcons, the Tomcats, Hornets, JSFs, and Raptors, and you have more combat aircraft lost to the stroke of a pen than to all the SAMs, Flak, and enemy fighters in history.
====
/html/body/div/p[205]:1120,1242
2 At least the assets weren’t scrapped, thank God, just mothballed in warehouses or that big desert graveyard at AMARC.
====
/html/body/div/p[205]:1242,1288
3 “Long-term investment,” they called it.
====
/html/body/div/p[205]:1288,1409
That’s the one thing you can always depend on; as we’re fighting one war, we’re always preparing for the next one.
====
/html/body/div/p[205]:1409,1481
Our airlift capacity, at least the organization, was almost left intact.
====
/html/body/div/p[206]
Almost?
====
/html/body/div/p[207]:0,86
The Globemasters had to go, so did anything else powered by a “gas guzzling” jet.
====
/html/body/div/p[207]:86,127
That left us with prop-powered aircraft.
====
/html/body/div/p[207]:127,221
I went from flying the closest thing to an X-Wing fighter, to the next best thing to a U-Haul.
====
/html/body/div/p[208]
Was that the main mission of the air force?
====
/html/body/div/p[209]
Airborne resupply was our primary objective, the only one that really counted anymore.

Islands in the Sea of Zack.
====
/html/body/div/p[217]:28,70
Green denotes active military facilities.
====
/html/body/div/p[217]:70,124
Some of them had been converted into refugee centers.
====
/html/body/div/p[217]:124,172
Some were still contributing to the war effort.
====
/html/body/div/p[217]:172,224
Some were well defended but had no strategic impact.
====
/html/body/div/p[218]:0,85
The Red Zones were labeled “Offensively Viable”: factories, mines, power plants.
====
/html/body/div/p[218]:85,144
The army’d left custodial teams during the big pullback.
====
/html/body/div/p[218]:144,263
Their job was to guard and maintain these facilities for a time when, if, we could add them to the overall war effort.
====
/html/body/div/p[218]:263,432
The Blue Zones were civilian areas where people had managed to make a stand, carve out a little piece of real estate, and figure some way to live within its boundaries.
====
/html/body/div/p[218]:432,535
All these zones were in need of resupply and that’s what the “Continental Airlift” was all about.
====
/html/body/div/p[219]:0,94
It was a massive operation, not just in terms of aircraft and fuel, but organization as well.
====
/html/body/div/p[219]:94,328
Remaining in contact with all these islands, processing their demands, coordinating with DeStRes, then trying to procure and prioritize all the materiel for each drop made it the statistically largest undertaking in air force history.
====
/html/body/div/p[220]:0,104
We tried to stay away from consumables, things like food and medicine that required regular deliveries.
====
/html/body/div/p[220]:104,264
These were classified as DDs, dependency drops, and they got a backseat to SSDs, self-sustaining drops, like tools, spare parts, and tools to make spare parts.
====
/html/body/div/p[220]:264,474
“They don’t need fish,” Sinclair used to say, “they need fishing poles.” Still, every autumn, we dropped a lot of fish, and wheat, and salt, and dried vegetables and baby formula…Winters were hard.
====
/html/body/div/p[220]:474,509
Remember how long they used to be?
====
/html/body/div/p[220]:509,600
Helping people to help themselves is great in theory, but you still gotta keep ’em alive.
====
/html/body/div/p[221]:0,152
Sometimes you had to drop in people, specialists like doctors or engineers, people with the kind of training you just can’t get from a how-to manual.
====
/html/body/div/p[221]:152,336
The Blue Zones got a lot of Special Forces instructors, not only to teach them how better to defend themselves, but to prepare them for the day they might have to go on the offensive.
====
/html/body/div/p[221]:336,376
I have a lot of respect for those guys.
====
/html/body/div/p[221]:376,524
Most of them knew it was for the duration; a lot of the Blue Zones didn’t have airstrips, so they had to parachute in without any hope of pickup.
====
/html/body/div/p[221]:524,566
Not all those Blue Zones remained secure.
====
/html/body/div/p[221]:566,596
Some were eventually overrun.
====
/html/body/div/p[221]:596,654
The people we dropped in knew the risks they were taking.
====
/html/body/div/p[221]:654,681
A lotta heart, all of them.
====
/html/body/div/p[222]
That goes for the pilots as well.
====
/html/body/div/p[223]:0,44
Hey, I’m not minimizing our risks at all.
====
/html/body/div/p[223]:44,140
Every day we had to fly over hundreds, in some cases thousands, of miles of infested territory.
====
/html/body/div/p[223]:140,174
That’s why we had Purple Zones.
====
/html/body/div/p[223]:174,216
[She refers to the last color on the map.
====
/html/body/div/p[223]:216,310
The purple circles are few and far between.] We set these up as refuel and repair facilities.
====
/html/body/div/p[223]:310,452
A lot of the aircraft didn’t have the range to reach remote drop zones on the East Coast if in-flight refueling assets weren’t available.
====
/html/body/div/p[223]:452,516
They helped reduce the number of ships and crews lost en route.
====
/html/body/div/p[223]:516,571
They brought our fleet survivability up to 92 percent.
====
/html/body/div/p[223]:571,616
Unfortunately, I was part of the other eight.
====
/html/body/div/p[224]:0,114
I’ll never be sure what exactly brought us down: mechanical malfunction or metal fatigue combined with weather.
====
/html/body/div/p[224]:114,188
It might have been the contents of our payload, mislabeled or mishandled.
====
/html/body/div/p[224]:188,248
That happened a lot more than anyone wanted to think about.
====
/html/body/div/p[224]:248,553
Sometimes if hazardous materials weren’t packaged properly, or, God forbid, some shit-for-brains QC inspector let his people assemble their detonators before crating them for travel…that happened to a buddy of mine, just a routine flight from Palmdale to Vandenberg, not even across an infested area.
====
/html/body/div/p[224]:553,696
Two hundred Type 38 detonators, all fully assembled with their power cells accidentally running, all set to blow on the same freq as our radio.

[She snaps her fingers.]
====
/html/body/div/p[227]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[228]:0,25
That could have been us.
====
/html/body/div/p[228]:25,102
We were on a hop from Phoenix to the Blue Zone outside Tallahassee, Florida.
====
/html/body/div/p[228]:102,153
It was late October, almost full winter back then.
====
/html/body/div/p[228]:153,254
Honolulu was trying to squeeze out just a few more drops before the weather socked us in till March.
====
/html/body/div/p[228]:254,287
It was our ninth haul that week.
====
/html/body/div/p[228]:287,405
We were all on “tweeks,” these little blue stims that kept you going without hampering your reflexes or judgment.
====
/html/body/div/p[228]:405,505
I guess they worked well enough, but they made me have to piss my kidneys out every twenty minutes.
====
/html/body/div/p[228]:505,599
My crew, the “guys,” used to give me a lot of grief, you know, girls always having to go.
====
/html/body/div/p[228]:599,697
I know they weren’t really putting the hate on, but I still tried to hold it as long as I could.
====
/html/body/div/p[229]:0,132
After two hours of banging around in some seriously heavy turbulence, I finally broke down and turned the stick over to my copilot.
====
/html/body/div/p[229]:132,271
I’d just zipped up when suddenly there was this massive jolt like God had just drop-kicked our tail…and suddenly our nose was dipping.
====
/html/body/div/p[229]:271,386
The head on our C-130 wasn’t even really a toilet, just a portable chempot with a heavy, plastic shower curtain.
====
/html/body/div/p[229]:386,434
That’s probably what ended up saving my life.
====
/html/body/div/p[229]:434,710
If I’d been trapped in a real compartment, maybe knocked out or unable to reach the latch…Suddenly there was this screech, this overpowering blast of high-pressure air and I was sucked out right through the rear of the aircraft, right past where the tail should have been.
====
/html/body/div/p[230]:0,33
I was spiraling, out of control.
====
/html/body/div/p[230]:33,118
I could just make out my ship, this gray mass shrinking and smoking on its way down.
====
/html/body/div/p[230]:118,159
I straightened myself out, hit my chute.
====
/html/body/div/p[230]:159,227
I was still in a daze, my head swimming, trying to catch my breath.
====
/html/body/div/p[230]:227,298
I fumbled for my radio and started hollering for my crew to punch out.
====
/html/body/div/p[230]:298,324
I didn’t get an answer.
====
/html/body/div/p[230]:324,397
All I could see was one other chute, the only other one that made it out.
====
/html/body/div/p[231]:0,65
That was the worst moment, right there, just hanging helplessly.
====
/html/body/div/p[231]:65,150
I could see the other chute, above and north of me by about three and a half clicks.
====
/html/body/div/p[231]:150,175
I looked for the others.
====
/html/body/div/p[231]:175,234
I tried my radio again, but wasn’t able to get a signal.
====
/html/body/div/p[231]:234,397
I figured it had been damaged during my “exit.” I tried to get my bearings, somewhere over southern Louisiana, a swampy wilderness that seemed to have no end.
====
/html/body/div/p[231]:397,452
I wasn’t sure exactly, my brain was still misfiring.
====
/html/body/div/p[231]:452,510
At least I had sense enough to check the bare essentials.
====
/html/body/div/p[231]:510,584
I could move my legs, my arms, I wasn’t in pain or bleeding externally.
====
/html/body/div/p[231]:584,726
I checked to make sure my survival kit was intact, still strapped to my thigh, and that my weapon, my Meg, 4 was still jamming me in the ribs.
====
/html/body/div/p[232]
Did the air force prepare you for situations like these?
====
/html/body/div/p[233]:0,101
We all had to pass the Willow Creek Escape and Evade program in the Klamath Mountains in California.
====
/html/body/div/p[233]:101,361
It even had a few real Gs in there with us, tagged and tracked and placed at specific marks to give us the “real feel.” It’s a lot like what they teach you in the civilian manual: movement, stealth, how to take out Zack before he can howl your position.
====
/html/body/div/p[233]:361,457
We all “made it,” lived, I mean, although a couple of pilots washed out on a Section Eight.
====
/html/body/div/p[233]:457,506
I guess they just couldn’t hack the real feel.
====
/html/body/div/p[233]:506,564
That never bothered me, being alone in hostile territory.
====
/html/body/div/p[233]:564,609
That was standard operating procedure for me.
====
/html/body/div/p[234]
Always?
====
/html/body/div/p[235]
You wanna talk about being alone in a hostile environment, try my four years at Colorado Springs.
====
/html/body/div/p[236]
But there were other women…
====
/html/body/div/p[237]:0,71
Other cadets, other competitors who happen to have the same genitalia.
====
/html/body/div/p[237]:71,134
Trust me, when the pressure kicked in, sisterhood punched out.
====
/html/body/div/p[237]:134,158
No, it was me, only me.
====
/html/body/div/p[237]:158,229
Self-contained, self-reliant, and always, unquestionably self-assured.
====
/html/body/div/p[237]:229,388
That’s the only thing that got me through four years of Academy hell, and it was the only thing I could count on as I hit the mud in the middle of G country.
====
/html/body/div/p[238]:0,120
I unclasped my chute—they teach you not to waste time concealing it—and headed in the direction of the other chute.
====
/html/body/div/p[238]:120,220
It took me a couple hours, splashing through this cold slime that numbed everything below my knees.
====
/html/body/div/p[238]:220,277
I wasn’t thinking clearly, my head was still spinning.
====
/html/body/div/p[238]:277,394
No excuse, I know, but that’s why I didn’t notice that the birds had suddenly beat it in the opposite direction.
====
/html/body/div/p[238]:394,444
I did hear the scream though, faint and far away.
====
/html/body/div/p[238]:444,488
I could see the chute tangled in the trees.
====
/html/body/div/p[238]:488,581
I started running, another no-no, making all that noise without stopping to listen for Zack.
====
/html/body/div/p[238]:581,679
I couldn’t see anything, just all these naked gray branches until they were right on top of me.
====
/html/body/div/p[238]:679,750
If it wasn’t for Rollins, my copilot, I’m sure I’da been a goner.
====
/html/body/div/p[239]:0,56
I found him dangling from his harness, dead, twitching.
====
/html/body/div/p[239]:56,196
His flight suit had been torn open 5 and his entrails were hanging…draped over five of them as they fed in this cloud of red-brown water.
====
/html/body/div/p[239]:196,279
One of them had managed to get its neck entangled in a section of small intestine.
====
/html/body/div/p[239]:279,355
Every time it moved it would jerk Rollins, ringing him like a fucking bell.
====
/html/body/div/p[239]:355,387
They didn’t notice me at all.
====
/html/body/div/p[239]:387,437
Close enough to touch and they didn’t even look.
====
/html/body/div/p[240]:0,52
At least I had the brains to snap on my suppressor.
====
/html/body/div/p[240]:52,107
I didn’t have to waste a whole clip, another fuckup.
====
/html/body/div/p[240]:107,162
I was so angry I almost started kicking their corpses.
====
/html/body/div/p[240]:162,206
I was so ashamed, so blinded by self-hate…
====
/html/body/div/p[241]
Self-hate?
====
/html/body/div/p[242]:0,21
I screwed the pooch!
====
/html/body/div/p[242]:21,40
My ship, my crew…
====
/html/body/div/p[243]:0,24
But it was an accident.
====
/html/body/div/p[243]:24,47
It wasn’t your fault.
====
/html/body/div/p[244]:0,22
How do you know that?
====
/html/body/div/p[244]:22,43
You weren’t there.
====
/html/body/div/p[244]:43,72
Shit, I wasn’t even there.
====
/html/body/div/p[244]:72,102
I don’t know what happened.
====
/html/body/div/p[244]:102,127
I wasn’t doing my job.
====
/html/body/div/p[244]:127,177
I was squatting over a bucket like a goddamn girl!
====
/html/body/div/p[245]:0,37
I found myself burning up, mentally.
====
/html/body/div/p[245]:37,85
Fucking weakling, I told myself, fucking loser.
====
/html/body/div/p[245]:85,167
I started to spiral, not just hating myself, but hating myself for hating myself.
====
/html/body/div/p[245]:167,193
Does that make any sense?
====
/html/body/div/p[245]:193,278
I’m sure I might have just stayed there, shaking and helpless and waiting for Zack.
====
/html/body/div/p[246]:0,37
But then my radio started squawking.
====
/html/body/div/p[246]:37,47
“Hello?
====
/html/body/div/p[246]:47,54
Hello?
====
/html/body/div/p[246]:54,75
Is anyone out there?
====
/html/body/div/p[246]:75,177
Anyone punch outta that wreck?” It was a woman’s voice, clearly civilian by her language and tone.
====
/html/body/div/p[247]:0,82
I answered immediately, identified myself, and demanded that she respond in kind.
====
/html/body/div/p[247]:82,181
She told me she was a skywatcher, and her handle was “Mets Fan,” or just “Mets” for short.
====
/html/body/div/p[247]:181,258
The Skywatch system was this ad hoc network of isolated ham radio operators.
====
/html/body/div/p[247]:258,356
They were supposed to report on downed aircrews and do what they could to help with their rescue.
====
/html/body/div/p[247]:356,472
It wasn’t the most efficient system, mainly because there were so few, but it looked like today was my lucky day.
====
/html/body/div/p[247]:472,657
She told me that she had seen the smoke and falling wreckage of my Herc’ and even though she was probably less than a day’s walk from my position, her cabin was heavily surrounded.
====
/html/body/div/p[247]:657,862
Before I could say anything she told me not to worry, that she’d already reported my position to search and rescue, and the best thing to do was to get to open ground where I could rendezvous for pickup.
====
/html/body/div/p[248]:0,89
I reached for my GPS but it had been torn from my suit when I was sucked out of my ship.
====
/html/body/div/p[248]:89,289
I had a backup survival map, but it was so big, so unspecific, and my hump took me over so many states that it was practically just a map of the U.S.…my head was still clouded with anger and doubt.
====
/html/body/div/p[248]:289,357
I told her I didn’t know my position, didn’t know where to go…
====
/html/body/div/p[249]:0,13
She laughed.
====
/html/body/div/p[249]:13,62
“You mean you’ve never made this run before?
====
/html/body/div/p[249]:62,117
You don’t have every inch of it committed to memory?
====
/html/body/div/p[249]:117,280
You didn’t see where you were as you were hanging by the silk?” She was so sure of me, trying to get me to think instead of just spoon-feeding me the answers.
====
/html/body/div/p[249]:280,453
I realized that I did know this area well, that I had flown over it at least twenty times in the last three months, and that I had to be somewhere in the Atchafalaya basin.
====
/html/body/div/p[249]:453,516
“Think,” she told me, “what did you see from your chute?
====
/html/body/div/p[249]:516,746
Were there any rivers, any roads?” At first, all I could remember were the trees, the endless gray landscape with no distinguishable features, and then gradually, as my brain cleared, I remembered seeing both rivers and a road.
====
/html/body/div/p[249]:746,828
I checked on the map and realized that directly north of me was the I-10 freeway.
====
/html/body/div/p[249]:828,884
Mets told me that was the best place for an S&R pickup.
====
/html/body/div/p[249]:884,1001
She told me it shouldn’t take any longer than a day or two at best if I got a move on and stopped burning daylight.
====
/html/body/div/p[250]:0,95
As I was about to leave, she stopped me and asked if there was anything I’d forgotten to do.
====
/html/body/div/p[250]:95,127
I remember that moment clearly.
====
/html/body/div/p[250]:127,153
I turned back to Rollins.
====
/html/body/div/p[250]:153,198
He was just starting to open his eyes again.
====
/html/body/div/p[250]:198,292
I felt like I should say something, apologize, maybe, then I put a round through his forehead.
====
/html/body/div/p[251]:0,106
Mets told me not to blame myself, and no matter what, not to let it distract me from the job I had to do.
====
/html/body/div/p[251]:106,223
She said, “Stay alive, stay alive and do your job.” Then she added, “And stop using up your weekend minutes.”
====
/html/body/div/p[252]:0,125
She was talking about battery power—she didn’t miss a trick—so I signed off and started moving north across the swamp.
====
/html/body/div/p[252]:125,207
My brain was now on full burner, all my lessons from the Creek came rolling back.
====
/html/body/div/p[252]:207,240
I stepped, I halted, I listened.
====
/html/body/div/p[252]:240,324
I stuck to dry ground where I could, and I made sure to pace myself very carefully.
====
/html/body/div/p[252]:324,383
I had to swim a couple times, that really made me nervous.
====
/html/body/div/p[252]:383,444
Twice I swear I could feel a hand just brush against my leg.
====
/html/body/div/p[252]:444,517
Once, I found a road, small, barely two lanes and in horrible disrepair.
====
/html/body/div/p[252]:517,569
Still, it was better than trudging through the mud.
====
/html/body/div/p[252]:569,657
I reported to Mets what I’d found and asked if it would take me right to the freeway.
====
/html/body/div/p[252]:657,736
She warned me to stay off it and every other road that crisscrossed the basin.
====
/html/body/div/p[252]:736,1058
“Roads mean cars,” she said, “and cars mean Gs.” She was talking about any bitten human drivers who died of their wounds while still behind the wheel and, because a ghoul doesn’t have the IQ points to open a door or unbuckle a seatbelt, would be doomed to spend the rest of their existence trapped in their cars.
====
/html/body/div/p[253]:0,41
I asked her what the danger of that was.
====
/html/body/div/p[253]:41,222
Since they couldn’t get out, and as long as I didn’t let them reach through an open window to grab me, what did it matter how many “abandoned” cars I passed along the road.
====
/html/body/div/p[253]:222,324
Mets reminded me that a trapped G was still able to moan and therefore still able to call for others.
====
/html/body/div/p[253]:324,351
Now I was really confused.
====
/html/body/div/p[253]:351,514
If I was going to waste so much time ducking a few back roads with a couple Zack-filled cars, why was I heading for a freeway that was sure to be jammed with them?
====
/html/body/div/p[254]:0,45
She said, “You’ll be up above the swamp.
====
/html/body/div/p[254]:45,207
How are more zombies gonna get to you?” Because it was built several stories above the swamp, this section of the I-10 was the safest place in the whole basin.
====
/html/body/div/p[254]:207,247
I confessed I hadn’t thought of that.
====
/html/body/div/p[254]:247,294
She laughed and said, “Don’t worry, honey.
====
/html/body/div/p[254]:294,302
I have.
====
/html/body/div/p[254]:302,343
Stick with me and I’ll get you home.”
====
/html/body/div/p[255]:0,11
And I did.
====
/html/body/div/p[255]:11,114
I stayed away from anything even resembling a road and stuck to as pure a wilderness track as I could.
====
/html/body/div/p[255]:114,242
I say “pure” but the truth was you couldn’t avoid all signs of humanity or what could have been humanity a long time ago.
====
/html/body/div/p[255]:242,326
There were shoes, clothes, bits of garbage, and tattered suitcases and hiking gear.
====
/html/body/div/p[255]:326,377
I saw a lot of bones on the patches of raised mud.
====
/html/body/div/p[255]:377,425
I couldn’t tell if they were human or animal.
====
/html/body/div/p[255]:425,499
One time I found this rib cage; I’m guessing it was a gator, a big one.
====
/html/body/div/p[255]:499,577
I didn’t want to think about how many Gs it took to bring that bastard down.
====
/html/body/div/p[256]:0,64
The first G I saw was small, probably a kid, I couldn’t tell.
====
/html/body/div/p[256]:64,226
Its face was eaten off, the skin, nose, eyes, lips, even the hair and ears…not completely gone, but partially hanging or stuck in patches to the exposed skull.
====
/html/body/div/p[256]:226,275
Maybe there were more wounds, I couldn’t tell.
====
/html/body/div/p[256]:275,415
It was stuck inside one of those long civilian hiker’s packs, stuffed in there tight with the drawstring pulled right up around its neck.
====
/html/body/div/p[256]:415,519
The shoulder straps had gotten tangled on the roots of a tree, it was splashing around, half submerged.
====
/html/body/div/p[256]:519,607
Its brain must have been intact, and even some of the muscle fibers connecting the jaw.
====
/html/body/div/p[256]:607,650
That jaw started snapping as I approached.
====
/html/body/div/p[256]:650,759
I don’t know how it knew I was there, maybe some of the nasal cavity was still intact, maybe the ear canal.
====
/html/body/div/p[257]:0,201
It couldn’t moan, its throat had been too badly mangled, but the splashing might have attracted attention, so I put it out of its misery, if it really was miserable, and tried not to think about it.
====
/html/body/div/p[257]:201,380
That was another thing they taught us at Willow Creek: don’t write their eulogy, don’t try to imagine who they used to be, how they came to be here, how they came to be this.
====
/html/body/div/p[257]:380,418
I know, who doesn’t do that, right?
====
/html/body/div/p[257]:418,496
Who doesn’t look at one of those things and just naturally start to wonder?
====
/html/body/div/p[257]:496,584
It’s like reading the last page of a book…your imagination just naturally spinning.
====
/html/body/div/p[257]:584,718
And that’s when you get distracted, get sloppy, let your guard down and end up leaving someone else to wonder what happened to you.
====
/html/body/div/p[257]:718,758
I tried to put her, it, out of my mind.
====
/html/body/div/p[257]:758,832
Instead, I found myself wondering why it had been the only one I’d seen.
====
/html/body/div/p[258]:0,202
That was a practical survival question, not just idle musings, so I got on the radio and asked Mets if there was something I was missing here, if maybe there was some area I should be careful to avoid.
====
/html/body/div/p[258]:202,370
She reminded me that this area was, for the most part, depopulated because the Blue Zones of Baton Rouge and Lafayette were pulling most of the Gs in either direction.
====
/html/body/div/p[258]:370,460
That was bittersweet comfort, being right between two of the heaviest clusters for miles.
====
/html/body/div/p[258]:460,528
She laughed, again…“Don’t worry about it, you’ll be fine.”
====
/html/body/div/p[259]:0,96
I saw something up ahead, a lump that was almost a thicket, but too boxy and shining in places.
====
/html/body/div/p[259]:96,119
I reported it to Mets.
====
/html/body/div/p[259]:119,197
She warned me not to go near it, keep on going and keep my eyes on the prize.
====
/html/body/div/p[259]:197,273
I was feeling pretty good by this point, a little of the old me coming back.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:0,72
As I got closer, I could see that it was a vehicle, a Lexus Hybrid SUV.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:72,145
It was covered in mud and moss and sitting in the water up to its doors.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:145,334
I could see that the rear windows were blocked with survival gear: tent, sleeping bag, cooking utensils, hunting rifle with boxes and boxes of shells, all new, some still in their plastic.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:334,407
I came around the driver’s side window and caught the glint of a .357.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:407,470
It was still clutched in the driver’s brown, shriveled hand.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:470,524
He was still sitting upright, looking straight ahead.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:524,578
There was light coming through the side of his skull.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:578,632
He was badly decomposed, at least a year, maybe more.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:632,732
He wore survival khakis, the kind you’d order from one of those upscale, hunting/safari catalogs.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:732,805
They were still clean and crisp, the only blood was from the head wound.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:805,858
I couldn’t see any other wound, no bites, nothing.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:858,919
That hit me hard, a lot harder than the little faceless kid.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:919,997
This guy had had everything he needed to survive, everything except the will.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:997,1026
I know that’s supposition.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:1026,1121
Maybe there was a wound I couldn’t see, hidden by his clothes or the advanced decomposition.
====
/html/body/div/p[260]:1121,1237
But I knew it, leaning there with my face against the glass, looking at this monument to how easy it was to give up.
====
/html/body/div/p[261]:0,79
I stood there for a moment, long enough for Mets to ask me what was happening.
====
/html/body/div/p[261]:79,157
I told her what I was seeing, and without pause, she told me to keep on going.
====
/html/body/div/p[262]:0,20
I started to argue.
====
/html/body/div/p[262]:20,104
I thought I should at least search the vehicle, see if there was anything I needed.
====
/html/body/div/p[262]:104,171
She asked me, sternly, if there was anything I needed, not wanted.
====
/html/body/div/p[262]:171,216
I thought about it, admitted there wasn’t.
====
/html/body/div/p[262]:216,333
His gear was plentiful, but it was civilian, big and bulky; the food needed cooking, the weapons weren’t silenced.
====
/html/body/div/p[262]:333,491
My survival kit was pretty thorough, and, if for some reason I didn’t find a helo waiting at the I-10, I could always use this as an emergency supply cache.
====
/html/body/div/p[263]:0,53
I brought up the idea of maybe using the SUV itself.
====
/html/body/div/p[263]:53,109
Mets asked if I had a tow truck and some jumper cables.
====
/html/body/div/p[263]:109,143
Almost like a kid, I answered no.
====
/html/body/div/p[263]:143,240
She asked, “Then what’s keeping you?” or something like that, pushing me to get a move on.
====
/html/body/div/p[263]:240,366
I told her to just wait a minute, I leaned my head against the driver’s side window, I sighed and felt beat again, drained.
====
/html/body/div/p[263]:366,398
Mets got on my ass, pushing me.
====
/html/body/div/p[263]:398,508
I snapped back for her to shut the fuck up, I just needed a minute, a couple seconds to…I don’t know what.
====
/html/body/div/p[264]:0,154
I must have kept my thumb on the “transmit” button for a few seconds too long, because Mets suddenly asked, “What was that?” “What?” I asked.
====
/html/body/div/p[264]:154,199
She’d heard something, something on my end.
====
/html/body/div/p[265]
She’d heard it before you?
====
/html/body/div/p[266]:0,110
I guess so, because in another second, once I’d cleared my head and opened my ears, I began to hear it too.
====
/html/body/div/p[266]:110,171
The moan…loud and close, followed by the splashing of feet.
====
/html/body/div/p[267]:0,150
I looked up, through the car’s window, the hole in the dead man’s skull, and the window on the other side, and that’s when I saw the first one.
====
/html/body/div/p[267]:150,216
I spun around and saw five more coming at me from all directions.
====
/html/body/div/p[267]:216,259
And behind them were another ten, fifteen.
====
/html/body/div/p[267]:259,311
I took a shot at the first one, the round went wild.
====
/html/body/div/p[268]:0,58
Mets started squawking at me, demanding a contact report.
====
/html/body/div/p[268]:58,193
I gave her a head count and she told me to stay cool, don’t try to run, just stay put and follow what I’d learned at Willow Creek.
====
/html/body/div/p[268]:193,287
I started to ask how she knew about Willow Creek when she shouted for me to shut up and fight.
====
/html/body/div/p[269]:0,126
I climbed to the top of the SUV—you’re supposed to look for the closest physical defense—and started to measure ranges.
====
/html/body/div/p[269]:126,191
I lined up my first target, took a deep breath, and dropped him.
====
/html/body/div/p[269]:191,301
To be a fighter jock is to be able to make decisions as fast as your electrochemical impulses can carry them.
====
/html/body/div/p[269]:301,372
I’d lost that nanosecond timing when I hit the mud, now it was back.
====
/html/body/div/p[269]:372,437
I was calm, I was focused, all the doubt and weakness were gone.
====
/html/body/div/p[269]:437,533
The whole engagement felt like ten hours, but I guess in reality, it was more like ten minutes.
====
/html/body/div/p[269]:533,593
Sixty-one in total, a nice thick ring of submerged corpses.
====
/html/body/div/p[269]:593,673
I took my time, checked my remaining ammo and waited for the next wave to come.
====
/html/body/div/p[269]:673,682
None did.
====
/html/body/div/p[270]:0,66
It was another twenty minutes before Mets asked me for an update.
====
/html/body/div/p[270]:66,142
I gave her a body count and she told me to remind her never to piss me off.
====
/html/body/div/p[270]:142,193
I laughed, the first time since I’d hit the mud.
====
/html/body/div/p[270]:193,234
I felt good again, strong and confident.
====
/html/body/div/p[270]:234,423
Mets warned me that all these distractions had erased any chance of making it to the I-10 before nightfall, and that I should probably start thinking about where I was gonna catch my forty.
====
/html/body/div/p[271]:0,139
I got as far away from the SUV as I could before the sky started to darken and found a decent enough perch in the branches of a tall tree.
====
/html/body/div/p[271]:139,270
My kit had this standard-issue microfiber hammock; great invention, light and strong and with clasps to keep you from rolling out.
====
/html/body/div/p[271]:270,365
That part was also supposed to help calm you down, help you get to sleep faster…yeah, right!
====
/html/body/div/p[271]:365,559
It didn’t matter that I’d already been up for close to forty-eight hours, that I’d tried all the breathing exercises they taught us at the Creek, or that I even slipped two of my Baby-Ls.
====
/html/body/div/p[271]:559,645
6 You’re only supposed to take one, but I figured that was for lightweight wussies.
====
/html/body/div/p[271]:645,717
I was me again, remember, I could handle it, and hey, I needed to sleep.
====
/html/body/div/p[272]:0,99
I asked her, since there was nothing else to do, or think about, if it was okay to talk about her.
====
/html/body/div/p[272]:99,120
Who was she, really?
====
/html/body/div/p[272]:120,194
How’d she end up in this isolated cabin in the middle of Cajun country?
====
/html/body/div/p[272]:194,262
She didn’t sound Cajun, she didn’t even have a southern accent.
====
/html/body/div/p[272]:262,351
And how did she know so much about pilot training without ever going through it herself?
====
/html/body/div/p[272]:351,453
I was starting to get my suspicions, starting to piece together a rough outline of who she really was.
====
/html/body/div/p[273]:0,90
Mets told me, again, that there would be plenty of time later for an episode of The View.
====
/html/body/div/p[273]:90,153
Right now I needed my sleep, and to check in with her at dawn.
====
/html/body/div/p[273]:153,233
I felt the Ls kick in between “check” and “in.” I was out by “dawn.”
====
/html/body/div/p[274]:0,14
I slept hard.
====
/html/body/div/p[274]:14,70
The sky was already light by the time I opened my eyes.
====
/html/body/div/p[274]:70,114
I’d been dreaming about, what else, Zack.
====
/html/body/div/p[274]:114,170
His moans were still echoing in my ears when I woke up.
====
/html/body/div/p[274]:170,299
And then I looked down and realized they weren’t dreams. There must have been at least a hundred of them surrounding the tree.
====
/html/body/div/p[274]:299,386
They were all reaching excitedly, all trying to climb over each other to get up to me.
====
/html/body/div/p[274]:386,454
At least they couldn’t ramp up, the ground wasn’t solid enough.
====
/html/body/div/p[274]:454,635
I didn’t have the ammo to take all of them out, and since a firefight might also buy time for more to show up, I decided it was best to pack up my gear and execute my escape plan.
====
/html/body/div/p[275]
You had planned for this?
====
/html/body/div/p[276]:0,70
Not really planned, but they’d trained us for situations like this.
====
/html/body/div/p[276]:70,209
It’s a lot like jumping from an aircraft: pick your approximate landing zone, tuck and roll, keep loose, and get up as quick as you can.
====
/html/body/div/p[276]:209,282
The goal is to put some serious distance between you and your attackers.
====
/html/body/div/p[276]:282,415
You take off running, jogging, or even “speed walking”; yes, they actually told us to consider this as a low-impact alternative.
====
/html/body/div/p[276]:415,491
The point is to get far enough way to give you time to plan your next move.
====
/html/body/div/p[276]:491,662
According to my map, the I-10 was close enough for me to make a run for it, be spotted by a rescue chopper, and be lifted off before these stink bags would ever catch up.
====
/html/body/div/p[276]:662,765
I got on the radio, reported my situation to Mets, and told her to signal S&R for an immediate pickup.
====
/html/body/div/p[276]:765,792
She told me to be careful.
====
/html/body/div/p[276]:792,855
I crouched, I jumped, and cracked my ankle on a submerged rock.
====
/html/body/div/p[277]:0,27
I hit the water, facedown.
====
/html/body/div/p[277]:27,102
Its chill was the only thing that kept me from blacking out from the pain.
====
/html/body/div/p[277]:102,194
I came up spluttering, choking, and the first thing I saw was the whole swarm coming at me.
====
/html/body/div/p[277]:194,284
Mets must have known something was up by the fact that I didn’t report my safe landing.
====
/html/body/div/p[277]:284,351
Maybe she asked me what had happened, although I don’t remember.
====
/html/body/div/p[277]:351,404
I just remember her yelling at me to get up and run.
====
/html/body/div/p[277]:404,488
I tried putting weight on my ankle, but lightning shot up through my leg and spine.
====
/html/body/div/p[277]:488,594
It could bear the weight, but…I screamed so loud, I’m sure she heard me through her cabin’s window.
====
/html/body/div/p[277]:594,720
“Get out of there,” she was yelling…“GO!” I started limping, splashing away with upwards of a hundred Gs on my ass.
====
/html/body/div/p[277]:720,777
It must have been comical, this frantic race of cripples.
====
/html/body/div/p[278]:0,59
Mets yelled, “If you can stand on it, you can run on it!
====
/html/body/div/p[278]:59,93
It’s not a weight-bearing bone!
====
/html/body/div/p[278]:93,112
You can do this!”
====
/html/body/div/p[279]:0,118
“But it hurts!” I actually said that, with tears running down my face, with Zack behind me howling for his lunch.
====
/html/body/div/p[279]:118,201
I reached the freeway, looming above the swamp like the ruins of a Roman aqueduct.
====
/html/body/div/p[279]:201,248
Mets had been right about its relative safety.
====
/html/body/div/p[279]:248,311
Only neither of us had counted on my injury or my undead tail.
====
/html/body/div/p[279]:311,442
There was no immediate entrance so I had to limp to one of the small, adjoining roads that Mets had originally warned me to avoid.
====
/html/body/div/p[279]:442,483
I could see why as I began to get close.
====
/html/body/div/p[279]:483,592
Wrecked and rusting cars were piled up by the hundreds and every tenth one had at least one G locked inside.
====
/html/body/div/p[279]:592,672
They saw me and started to moan, the sound carried for miles in every direction.
====
/html/body/div/p[280]:0,47
Mets shouted, “Don’t worry about that now!
====
/html/body/div/p[280]:47,105
Just get on the on-ramp and watch the fucking grabbers!”
====
/html/body/div/p[281]
Grabbers?
====
/html/body/div/p[282]:0,42
The ones reaching through broken windows.
====
/html/body/div/p[282]:42,156
On the open road, I at least had a chance of dodging them, but on the on-ramp, you’re hemmed in on either side.
====
/html/body/div/p[282]:156,242
That was the worst part, by far, those few minutes trying to get up onto the freeway.
====
/html/body/div/p[282]:242,322
I had to go in between the cars; my ankle wouldn’t let me get on top of them.
====
/html/body/div/p[282]:322,403
These rotting hands would reach out for me, grabbing my flight suit or my wrist.
====
/html/body/div/p[282]:403,457
Every head shot cost me seconds that I didn’t have.
====
/html/body/div/p[282]:457,504
The steep incline was already slowing me down.
====
/html/body/div/p[282]:504,592
My ankle was throbbing, my lungs were aching, and the swarm was now gaining on me fast.
====
/html/body/div/p[282]:592,623
If it hadn’t been for Mets…
====
/html/body/div/p[283]:0,39
She was shouting at me the whole time.
====
/html/body/div/p[283]:39,117
“Move your ass, you fuckin’ bitch!” She was getting pretty raw by then.
====
/html/body/div/p[283]:117,221
“Don’t you dare quit…don’t you DARE crap out on me!” She never let up, never gave me an inch.
====
/html/body/div/p[283]:221,297
“What are you, some weak little victim?” At that point I thought I was.
====
/html/body/div/p[283]:297,327
I knew I could never make it.
====
/html/body/div/p[283]:327,416
The exhaustion, the pain, more than anything, I think, the anger at fucking up so badly.
====
/html/body/div/p[283]:416,505
I actually considered turning my pistol around, wanting to punish myself for…you know.
====
/html/body/div/p[283]:505,534
And then Mets really hit me.
====
/html/body/div/p[283]:534,588
She roared, “What are you, your fucking mother!?!”
====
/html/body/div/p[284]:0,13
That did it.
====
/html/body/div/p[284]:13,55
I hauled ass right up onto the interstate.
====
/html/body/div/p[285]
I reported to Mets that I’d made it, then asked, “Now what the fuck do I do?”
====
/html/body/div/p[286]:0,34
Her voice suddenly got very soft.
====
/html/body/div/p[286]:34,58
She told me to look up.
====
/html/body/div/p[286]:58,117
A black dot was heading at me from out of the morning sun.
====
/html/body/div/p[286]:117,194
It was following the freeway and grew very quickly into the form of a UH-60.
====
/html/body/div/p[286]:194,239
I let out a whoop and popped my signal flare.
====
/html/body/div/p[287]:0,120
The first thing I saw when they winched me aboard was that it was a civilian chopper, not government Search and Rescue.
====
/html/body/div/p[287]:120,198
The crew chief was a big Cajun with a thick goatee and wraparound sunglasses.
====
/html/body/div/p[287]:198,279
He asked, “Where de’ hell you come from?” Sorry if I butchered the accent.
====
/html/body/div/p[287]:279,336
I almost cried and punched him in his thigh-sized bicep.
====
/html/body/div/p[287]:336,376
I laughed and said that they work fast.
====
/html/body/div/p[287]:376,441
He shot me a look like I didn’t know what I was talking about.
====
/html/body/div/p[287]:441,562
It turned out later that this wasn’t the rescue team but just a routine air shuttle between Baton Rouge and Lafayette.
====
/html/body/div/p[287]:562,615
I didn’t know at that moment, and I didn’t care.
====
/html/body/div/p[287]:615,673
I reported to Mets that I got my pickup, that I was safe.
====
/html/body/div/p[287]:673,848
I thanked her for everything she’d done for me, and…and so I wouldn’t really start bawling, I tried to cover with a joke about finally getting that episode of The View.
====
/html/body/div/p[287]:848,871
I never got a response.
====
/html/body/div/p[288]
She sounds like a hell of a Skywatcher.
====
/html/body/div/p[289]
She was a hell of a woman.
====
/html/body/div/p[290]
You said you had your “suspicions” by this point.
====
/html/body/div/p[291]:0,101
No civilian, even a veteran Skywatcher, could know so much about what goes into wearing those wings.
====
/html/body/div/p[291]:101,221
She was just too savvy, too informed, the kind of baseline knowledge of someone who had to have gone through it herself.
====
/html/body/div/p[292]
So she was a pilot.
====
/html/body/div/p[293]:0,85
Definitely; not air force—I would have known her—but maybe a squid or a jarhead.
====
/html/body/div/p[293]:85,206
They’d lost as many pilots as the air force on resupply hops like mine, and eight out of ten were never accounted for.
====
/html/body/div/p[293]:206,339
I’m sure that she must have run into a situation like mine, had to ditch, lost her crew, maybe even blamed herself for it like me.
====
/html/body/div/p[293]:339,435
Somehow she managed to find that cabin and spent the rest of the war as one kick-ass Skywatcher.
====
/html/body/div/p[294]
That makes sense.
====
/html/body/div/p[295]
Doesn’t it?
====
/html/body/div/p[296]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[297]:0,28
[There is an awkward pause.
====
/html/body/div/p[297]:28,65
I search her face, waiting for more.]
====
/html/body/div/p[298]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[299]
What?
====
/html/body/div/p[300]
They never found her.
====
/html/body/div/p[301]
No.
====
/html/body/div/p[302]
Or the cabin.
====
/html/body/div/p[303]
No.
====
/html/body/div/p[304]
And Honolulu never had any record of a Skywatcher with the call sign Mets Fan.
====
/html/body/div/p[305]
You’ve done your homework.
====
/html/body/div/p[306]
I…
====
/html/body/div/p[307]
You probably also read my after-action report, right?
====
/html/body/div/p[308]
Yes.
====
/html/body/div/p[309]
And the psych evaluation they tacked on after my official debriefing.
====
/html/body/div/p[310]
Well…
====
/html/body/div/p[311]:0,29
Well, it’s bullshit, okay?
====
/html/body/div/p[311]:29,311
So what if everything she told me was information I’d already been briefed on, so what if the psych team “claim” my radio was knocked out before I hit the mud, and so the fuck what if Mets is short for Metis, the mother of Athena, the Greek goddess with the stormy gray eyes.
====
/html/body/div/p[311]:311,427
Oh, the shrinks had a ball with that one, especially when they “discovered” that my mother grew up in the Bronx.
====
/html/body/div/p[312]
And that remark she made about your mother?
====
/html/body/div/p[313]:0,43
Who the hell doesn’t have mother issues?
====
/html/body/div/p[313]:43,91
If Mets was a pilot, she was a natural gambler.
====
/html/body/div/p[313]:91,268
She knew she had a good chance of scoring a hit with “mom.” She knew the risk, took her shot…Look, if they thought I’d cracked up, why didn’t I lose my flight status?
====
/html/body/div/p[313]:268,303
Why did they let me have this job?
====
/html/body/div/p[313]:303,435
Maybe she wasn’t a pilot herself, maybe she was married to one, maybe she’d wanted to be one but never made it as far as I did.
====
/html/body/div/p[313]:435,562
Maybe she was just a scared, lonely voice that did what she could to help another scared lonely voice from ending up like her.
====
/html/body/div/p[313]:562,592
Who cares who she was, or is?
====
/html/body/div/p[313]:592,681
She was there when I needed her, and for the rest of my life, she’ll always be with me.

When I say that the New World doesn’t have our history of fixed fortifications, I’m only referring to North America.
====
/html/body/div/p[319]:121,256
There are the Spanish coastal fortresses, naturally, along the Caribbean, and the ones we and the French built in the Lesser Antilles.
====
/html/body/div/p[319]:256,347
Then there are the Inca ruins in the Andes, although they never experienced direct sieges.
====
/html/body/div/p[319]:347,630
1 Also, when I say “North America,” that does not include the Mayan and Aztec ruins in Mexico—that business with the Battle of Kukulcan, although I suppose that’s Toltec, now, isn’t it, when those chaps held off so many Zed Heads on the steps of that bloody great pyramid.
====
/html/body/div/p[319]:630,716

Castles.

Well…I don’t want for a moment to overstate their importance for the general war effort.
====
/html/body/div/p[325]:114,338
In fact, when you compare them to any other type of fixed fortification, modern, modified, and so forth, their contribution does seem quite negligible, unless you’re like me, and that contribution was what saved your life.

/html/body/div/p[326]:0,66
This doesn’t mean that a mighty fortress was naturally our God.
====
/html/body/div/p[326]:66,155
For starters, you must understand the inherent difference between a castle and a palace.
====
/html/body/div/p[326]:155,325
A lot of so-called castles were really nothing more than just great impressive homes, or else had been converted to such after their defensive value had become obsolete.
====
/html/body/div/p[326]:325,468
These once impregnable bastions now had so many windows cut into the ground floor that it would have taken forever to brick them all up again.

/html/body/div/p[326]:468,545
You’d be better off in a modern block of flats with the staircase removed.
====
/html/body/div/p[326]:545,715
And as far as those palaces that were built as nothing more than status symbols, places like Chateau Ussé or Prague “Castle,” they were little more than death traps.
====
/html/body/div/p[327]:0,25
Just look at Versailles.

/html/body/div/p[327]:25,56

It blew a hole right through the wall and the dead surged in like water through a breached dam.
====
/html/body/div/p[330]:0,48
At least that was a mistake based on ignorance.
====
/html/body/div/p[330]:48,118
I can’t even begin to forgive what happened at Chateau de Fougeres.
====
/html/body/div/p[330]:118,220
They were running low on supplies, thought that they could dig a tunnel under their undead attackers.
====
/html/body/div/p[330]:220,268
What did they think this was, The Great Escape?
====
/html/body/div/p[330]:268,320
Did they have any professional surveyors with them?
====
/html/body/div/p[330]:320,373
Did they even understand the basics of trigonometry?
====
/html/body/div/p[330]:373,477
The bloody tunnel exit fell short by over half a kilometer, came up right in a nest of the damn things.
====
/html/body/div/p[330]:477,560
Stupid wankers hadn’t even thought to equip their tunnel with demolition charges.
====
/html/body/div/p[331]:0,80
Yes, there were cock-ups aplenty, but there were also some noteworthy triumphs.
====
/html/body/div/p[331]:80,184
Many were subjected to only short-term sieges, the good fortune of being on the right side of the line.
====
/html/body/div/p[331]:184,287
Some in Spain, Bavaria, or Scotland above the Antonine 2 only had to hold out for weeks, or even days.
====
/html/body/div/p[331]:287,377
For some, like Kisimul, it was only a question of getting through one rather dodgy night.
====
/html/body/div/p[331]:377,526
But then there were the true tales of victory, like Chenonceau in France, a bizarre little Disneyesque castle built on a bridge over the Cher River.
====
/html/body/div/p[331]:526,658
With both connections to land severed, and the right amount of strategic forethought, they managed to hold their position for years.
====
/html/body/div/p[332]
They had enough supplies for years?
====
/html/body/div/p[333]:0,18
Oh good lord, no.
====
/html/body/div/p[333]:18,98
They simply waited for first snowfall, then raided the surrounding countryside.
====
/html/body/div/p[333]:98,191
This was, I should imagine, standard procedure for almost anyone under siege, castle or not.
====
/html/body/div/p[333]:191,313
I’m sure those in your strategic “Blue Zones,” at least those above the snowline, operated in much the same manner.
====
/html/body/div/p[333]:313,382
In that way we were fortunate that most of Europe freezes in winter.
====
/html/body/div/p[333]:382,527
Many of the defenders I’ve spoken to have agreed that the inevitable onset of winter, long and brutal as it was, became a lifesaving reprieve.
====
/html/body/div/p[333]:527,712
As long as they didn’t freeze to death, many survivors took the opportunity of frozen Zed Heads to raid the surrounding countryside for everything they’d need for the warmer months.
====
/html/body/div/p[334]:0,202
It’s not surprising how many defenders chose to remain in their strongholds even with the opportunity to flee, be it Bouillon in Belgium or Spis in Slovakia or even back home like Beaumaris in Wales.
====
/html/body/div/p[334]:202,328
Before the war, the place had been nothing but a museum piece, a hollow shell of roofless chambers and high concentric walls.
====
/html/body/div/p[334]:328,476
The town council should be given the VC for their accomplishments, pooling resources, organizing citizens, restoring this ruin to its former glory.
====
/html/body/div/p[334]:476,553
They had just a few months before the crisis engulfed their part of Britain.
====
/html/body/div/p[334]:553,659
Even more dramatic is the story of Conwy, both a castle and medieval wall that protected the entire town.
====
/html/body/div/p[334]:659,863
The inhabitants not only lived in safety and relative comfort during the stalemate years, their access to the sea allowed Conwy to become a springboard for our forces once we began to retake our country.

Have you ever read Camelot Mine?

[I shake my head.]

====
/html/body/div/p[338]:0,31
You must find yourself a copy.
====
/html/body/div/p[338]:31,140
It’s a cracking good novel, based on the author’s own experiences as one of the defenders of Caerphilly.
====
/html/body/div/p[338]:140,210
He began the crisis on the second floor of his flat in Ludlow, Wales.
====
/html/body/div/p[338]:210,322
As his supplies ran out and the first snow fell, he decided to strike out in search of more permanent lodgings.
====
/html/body/div/p[338]:322,441
He came upon the abandoned ruin, which had already been the sight of a halfhearted, and ultimately fruitless, defense.
====
/html/body/div/p[338]:441,540
He buried the bodies, smashed the frozen Zed Heads, and set about restoring the castle on his own.
====
/html/body/div/p[338]:540,599
He worked tirelessly, in the most brutal winter on record.
====
/html/body/div/p[338]:599,736
By May, Caerphilly was prepared for the summer siege, and by the following winter, it became a haven for several hundred other survivors.
====
/html/body/div/p[339]

/html/body/div/p[340]
[He shows me some of his sketches.]
====
/html/body/div/p[341]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[342]
A masterpiece, isn’t it, second largest in the British Isles.
====
/html/body/div/p[343]
What’s the first?
====
/html/body/div/p[344]
[He hesitates.]
====
/html/body/div/p[345]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[346]
Windsor.
====
/html/body/div/p[347]
Windsor was your castle.
====
/html/body/div/p[348]
Well, not mine personally.
====
/html/body/div/p[349]
I mean, you were there.
====
/html/body/div/p[350]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[351]
[Another pause.]
====
/html/body/div/p[352]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[353]:0,79
It was, from a defensive standpoint, as close as one could come to perfection.
====
/html/body/div/p[353]:79,165
Before the war, it was the largest inhabited castle in Europe, almost thirteen acres.
====
/html/body/div/p[353]:165,261
It had its own well for water, and enough storage space to house a decade’s worth of rations.
====
/html/body/div/p[353]:261,412
The fire of 1992 led to a state-of-the-art suppression system, and the subsequent terrorist threats upgraded security measures to rival any in the UK.
====
/html/body/div/p[353]:412,609
Not even the general public knew what their tax dollars were paying for: bulletproof glass, reinforced walls, retractable bars, and steel shutters hidden so cleverly in windowsills and door frames.
====
/html/body/div/p[354]:0,172
But of all our achievements at Windsor, nothing can rival the siphoning of crude oil and natural gas from the deposit several kilometers beneath the castle’s foundation.
====
/html/body/div/p[354]:172,282
It had been discovered in the 1990s but never exploited for a variety of political and environmental reasons.
====
/html/body/div/p[354]:282,323
You can believe we exploited it, though.
====
/html/body/div/p[354]:323,438
Our contingent of royal engineers rigged a scaffolding up and over our wall, and extended it to the drilling site.
====
/html/body/div/p[354]:438,539
It was quite an achievement, and you can see how it became the precursor to our fortified motorways.
====
/html/body/div/p[354]:539,660
On a personal level, I was just grateful for the warm rooms, hot food, and, in a pinch…the Molotovs and flaming ditch.
====
/html/body/div/p[354]:660,928
It’s not the most efficient way to stop a Zed Head, I know, but as long as you’ve got them stuck and can keep them in the fire…and besides, what else could we do when the bullets ran out and we were left with nothing else but an odd lot of medieval hand weapons?
====
/html/body/div/p[355]:0,111
There were quite a bit of those about, in museums, personal collections…and not a decorative dud among them.
====
/html/body/div/p[355]:111,146
These were real, tough and tested.
====
/html/body/div/p[355]:146,272
They became part of British life again, ordinary citizens traipsing about with a mace or halberd or double-bladed battle-axe.
====
/html/body/div/p[355]:272,371
I myself became rather adept with this claymore, although you wouldn’t think of it to look at me.

It’s not really ideal, takes a lot of skill, but eventually you learn what you can do, what you never thought you were capable of, what others around you are capable of.

[David hesitates before speaking.
====
/html/body/div/p[361]:34,63
He is clearly uncomfortable.

I hold out my hand.]
====
/html/body/div/p[362]
 
====
/html/body/div/p[363]
Thank you so much for taking the time…
====
/html/body/div/p[364]
There’s…more.
====
/html/body/div/p[365]
If you’re not comfortable…
====
/html/body/div/p[366]
No, please, it’s quite all right.
====
/html/body/div/p[367]:0,55
[Takes a breath.] She…she wouldn’t leave, you see.
====
/html/body/div/p[367]:55,239
She insisted, over the objections of Parliament, to remain at Windsor, as she put it, “for the duration.” I thought maybe it was misguided nobility, or maybe fear-based paralysis.
====
/html/body/div/p[367]:239,302
I tried to make her see reason, begged her almost on my knees.
====
/html/body/div/p[367]:302,439
Hadn’t she done enough with the Balmoral Decree, turning all her estates into protected zones for any who could reach and defend them?
====
/html/body/div/p[367]:439,598
Why not join her family in Ireland or the Isle of Man, or, at least, if she was insisting on remaining in Britain, supreme command HQ north above the Antonine.
====
/html/body/div/p[368]
What did she say?
====
/html/body/div/p[369]:0,385
“The highest of distinctions is service to others.” [He clears his throat, his upper lip quivers for a second.] Her father had said that; it was the reason he had refused to run to Canada during the Second World War, the reason her mother had spent the blitz visiting civilians huddled in the tube stations beneath London, the same reason, to this day, we remain a United Kingdom.
====
/html/body/div/p[369]:385,470
Their task, their mandate, is to personify all that is great in our national spirit.
====
/html/body/div/p[369]:470,574
They must forever be an example to the rest of us, the strongest, and bravest, and absolute best of us.
====
/html/body/div/p[369]:574,746
In a sense, it is they who are ruled by us, instead of the other way around, and they must sacrifice everything, everything, to shoulder the weight of this godlike burden.
====
/html/body/div/p[369]:746,785
Otherwise what’s the flipping point?
====
/html/body/div/p[369]:785,886
Just scrap the whole damn tradition, roll out the bloody guillotine, and be done with it altogether.
====
/html/body/div/p[369]:886,1033
They were viewed very much like castles, I suppose: as crumbling, obsolete relics, with no real modern function other than as tourist attractions.
====
/html/body/div/p[369]:1033,1132
But when the skies darkened and the nation called, both reawoke to the meaning of their existence.
====
/html/body/div/p[369]:1132,1178
One shielded our bodies, the other, our souls.

ULITHI ATOLL, FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA
====
/html/body/div/p[371]:0,113
[During World War II, this vast coral atoll served as the main forward base for the United States Pacific Fleet.
====
/html/body/div/p[371]:113,219
During World War Z, it sheltered not only American naval vessels, but hundreds of civilian ships as well.
====
/html/body/div/p[371]:219,301
One of those ships was the UNS Ural, the first broadcast hub of Radio Free Earth.

Now a museum to the achievements of the project, she is the focus of the British documentary Words at War.

Ignorance was the enemy.
====
/html/body/div/p[373]:25,80
Lies and superstition, misinformation, disinformation.
====
/html/body/div/p[373]:80,114
Sometimes, no information at all.
====
/html/body/div/p[373]:114,151
Ignorance killed billions of people.
====
/html/body/div/p[373]:151,184
Ignorance caused the Zombie War.
====
/html/body/div/p[373]:184,231
Imagine if we had known then what we know now.
====
/html/body/div/p[373]:231,309
Imagine if the undead virus had been as understood as, say, tuberculosis was.
====
/html/body/div/p[373]:309,443
Imagine if the world’s citizens, or at least those charged with protecting those citizens, had known exactly what they were facing.

/html/body/div/p[373]:443,511
Ignorance was the real enemy, and cold, hard facts were the weapons.

When I first joined Radio Free Earth, it was still called the International Program for Health and Safety Information.
====
/html/body/div/p[374]:119,223
The title “Radio Free Earth” came from the individuals and communities who monitored our broadcasts.
====
/html/body/div/p[375]:0,140
It was the first real international venture, barely a few months after the South African Plan, and years before the conference at Honolulu.
====
/html/body/div/p[375]:140,256
Just like the rest of the world based their survival strategies on Redeker, our genesis was routed in Radio Ubunye.
====
/html/body/div/p[375]:256,257
1
====
/html/body/div/p[376]
What was Radio Ubunye?
====
/html/body/div/p[377]:0,54
South Africa’s broadcasts to its isolated citizens.
====
/html/body/div/p[377]:54,178
Because they didn’t have the resources for material aid, the only assistance the government could render was information.
====
/html/body/div/p[377]:178,275
They were the first, at least, to my knowledge, to begin these regular, multilingual broadcasts.
====
/html/body/div/p[377]:275,428
Not only did they offer practical survival skills, they went so far as to collect and address each and every falsehood circulating among their citizens.
====
/html/body/div/p[377]:428,516
What we did was take the template of Radio Ubunye and adapt it for the global community.
====
/html/body/div/p[378]:0,107
I came aboard, literally, at the very beginning, as the Ural’s reactors were just being put back online.
====
/html/body/div/p[378]:107,183
The Ural was a former vessel of the Soviet, then the Russian, Federal Navy.
====
/html/body/div/p[378]:183,318
Back then the SSV-33 had been many things: a command and control ship, a missile tracking platform, an electronic surveillance vessel.
====
/html/body/div/p[378]:318,443
Unfortunately, she was also a white elephant, because her systems, they tell me, were too complicated even for her own crew.
====
/html/body/div/p[378]:443,586
She had spent the majority of her career tied to a pier at the Vladivostok naval base, providing additional electrical power for the facility.
====
/html/body/div/p[378]:586,765
I am not an engineer, so I don’t how they managed to replace her spent fuel rods or convert her massive communication facilities to interface with the global satellite network.
====
/html/body/div/p[378]:765,839
I specialize in languages, specifically those of the Indian Subcontinent.

Myself and Mister Verma, just the two of us to cover a billion people…well…at that point it was still a billion.
====
/html/body/div/p[379]:0,60
Mister Verma had found me in the refugee camp in Sri Lanka.
====
/html/body/div/p[379]:60,103
He was a translator, I was an interpreter.
====
/html/body/div/p[379]:103,185
We had worked together several years before at our country’s embassy in London.
====
/html/body/div/p[379]:185,240
We thought it had been hard work then; we had no idea.
====
/html/body/div/p[379]:240,306
It was a maddening grind, eighteen, sometimes twenty hours a day.
====
/html/body/div/p[379]:306,336
I don’t know when we slept.
====
/html/body/div/p[379]:336,406
There was so much raw data, so many dispatches arriving every minute.
====
/html/body/div/p[379]:406,545
Much of it had to do with basic survival: how to purify water, create an indoor greenhouse, culture and process mold spore for penicillin.
====
/html/body/div/p[379]:545,649
This mind-numbing copy would often be punctuated with facts and terms that I had never heard of before.
====
/html/body/div/p[379]:649,783
I’d never heard the term “quisling” or “feral”; I didn’t know what a “Lobo” was or the false miracle cure of Phalanx.
====
/html/body/div/p[379]:783,968
All I knew was that suddenly there was a uniformed man shoving a collection of words before my eyes and telling me “We need this in Marathi, and ready to record in fifteen minutes.”

Spiritual?

/html/body/div/p[381]:73,88
Psychological?
====
/html/body/div/p[381]:88,141
The psychological aspect I found the most maddening.
====
/html/body/div/p[381]:141,204
People wanted so badly to anthropomorphize the walking blight.
====
/html/body/div/p[381]:204,330
In war, in a conventional war that is, we spend so much time trying to dehumanize the enemy, to create an emotional distance.
====
/html/body/div/p[381]:330,619
We would make up stories or derogatory titles…when I think about what my father used to call Muslims…and now in this war it seemed that everyone was trying desperately to find some shred of a connection to their enemy, to put a human face on something that was so unmistakably inhuman.
====
/html/body/div/p[382]
Can you give me some examples?
====
/html/body/div/p[383]:0,254
There were so many misconceptions: zombies were somehow intelligent; they could feel and adapt, use tools and even some human weapons; they carried memories of their former existence; or they could be communicated with and trained like some kind of pet.
====
/html/body/div/p[383]:254,327
It was heartbreaking, having to debunk one misguided myth after another.
====
/html/body/div/p[383]:327,394
The civilian survival guide helped, but was still severely limited.
====
/html/body/div/p[384]
Oh really?
====
/html/body/div/p[385]:0,8
Oh yes.
====
/html/body/div/p[385]:8,248
You could see it was clearly written by an American, the references to SUVs and personal firearms. There was no taking into account the cultural differences…the various indigenous solutions people believed would save them from the undead.
====
/html/body/div/p[386]
Such as?
====
/html/body/div/p[387]:0,138
I’d rather not give too many details, not without tacitly condemning the entire people group from which this “solution” originated.
====
/html/body/div/p[387]:138,236
As an Indian, I had to deal with many aspects of my own culture that had turned self-destructive.
====
/html/body/div/p[387]:236,417
There was Varanasi, one of the oldest cities on Earth, near the place where Buddha supposedly preached his first sermon and where thousands of Hindu pilgrims came each year to die.
====
/html/body/div/p[387]:417,488
In normal, prewar conditions, the road would be littered with corpses.
====
/html/body/div/p[387]:488,529
Now these corpses were rising to attack.
====
/html/body/div/p[387]:529,599
Varanasi was one of the hottest White Zones, a nexus of living death.
====
/html/body/div/p[387]:599,658
This nexus covered almost the entire length of the Ganges.
====
/html/body/div/p[387]:658,796
Its healing powers had been scientifically assessed decades before the war, something to do with the high oxygenation rate of the waters.

Even after the government’s withdrawal to the Himalayas, when over 90 percent of the country was officially overrun, the pilgrimages continued.

Every country had a similar story.

/html/body/div/p[387]:1052,1180
Every one of our international crew had at least one moment when they were forced to confront an example of suicidal ignorance.

/html/body/div/p[387]:1180,1374
An American told us about how the religious sect known as “God’s Lambs” believed that the rapture had finally come and the quicker they were infected, the quicker they would go to heaven.
====
/html/body/div/p[387]:1374,1684
Another woman—I won’t say what country she belonged to—tried her best to dispel the notion that sexual intercourse with a virgin could “cleanse” the “curse.” I don’t know how many women, or little girls, were raped as a result of this “cleansing.” Everyone was furious with his own people.
====
/html/body/div/p[387]:1684,1706
Everyone was ashamed.
====
/html/body/div/p[387]:1706,1769
Our one Belgian crewmember compared it to the darkening skies.
====
/html/body/div/p[387]:1769,1826
He used to call it “the evil of our collective soul.”
====
/html/body/div/p[388]:0,37
I guess I have no right to complain.
====
/html/body/div/p[388]:37,92
My life was never in danger, my belly was always full.
====
/html/body/div/p[388]:92,162
I might not have slept often but at least I could sleep without fear.

/html/body/div/p[388]:162,234
Most importantly, I never had had to work in the Ural’s IR department.
====
/html/body/div/p[389]
IR?
====
/html/body/div/p[390]:0,23
Information Reception.
====
/html/body/div/p[390]:23,88
The data we were broadcasting did not originate aboard the Ural.
====
/html/body/div/p[390]:88,186
It came from all around the world, from experts and think tanks in various government safe zones.
====
/html/body/div/p[390]:186,282
They would transmit their findings to our IR operators who, in turn, would pass it along to us.

Much of this data was transmitted to us over conventional, open, civilian bands, and many of these bands were crammed with ordinary people’s cries for help.
====
/html/body/div/p[390]:441,661
There were millions of wretched souls scattered throughout our planet, all screaming into their private radio sets as their children starved or their temporary fortress burned, or the living dead overran their defenses.
====
/html/body/div/p[390]:661,793
Even if you didn’t understand the language, as many of the operators didn’t, there was no mistaking the human voice of anguish.
====
/html/body/div/p[390]:793,861
They weren’t allowed to answer back, either; there wasn’t time.
====
/html/body/div/p[390]:861,919
All transmissions had to be devoted to official business.
====
/html/body/div/p[390]:919,982
I don’t want to know what that was like for the IR operators.
====
/html/body/div/p[391]:0,149
When the last broadcast came from Buenos Aires, when that famous Latin singer played that Spanish lullaby, it was too much for one of our operators.
====
/html/body/div/p[391]:149,217
He wasn’t from Buenos Aires, he wasn’t even from South America.
====
/html/body/div/p[391]:217,315
He was just an eighteen-year-old Russian sailor who blew his brains out all over his instruments.
====
/html/body/div/p[391]:315,412
He was the first, and since the end of the war, the rest of the IR operators have followed suit.
====
/html/body/div/p[391]:412,444
Not one of them is alive today.
====
/html/body/div/p[391]:444,476
The last was my Belgian friend.
====
/html/body/div/p[391]:476,539
“You carry those voices with you,” he told me one morning.
====
/html/body/div/p[391]:539,647
We were standing on the deck, looking into that brown haze, waiting for a sunrise we knew we’d never see.
====
/html/body/div/p[391]:647,769
“Those cries will be with me the rest of my life, never resting, never fading, never ceasing their call to join them.”

THE DEMILITARIZED ZONE: SOUTH KOREA
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[2]:0,141
[Hyungchol Choi, deputy director of the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, gestures to the dry, hilly, unremarkable landscape to our north.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[2]:141,298
One might mistake it for Southern California, if not for the deserted pillboxes, fading banners, and rusting, barbed wire fence that runs to either horizon.]
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[3]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[4]:0,15
What happened?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[4]:15,29
No one knows.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[4]:29,103
No country was better prepared to repel the infestation than North Korea.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[4]:103,255
Rivers to the north, oceans to the east and west, and to the south [he gestures to the Demilitarized Zone], the most heavily fortified border on Earth.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[4]:255,438
You can see how mountainous the terrain is, how easily defensible, but what you can’t see is that those mountains are honeycombed with a titanic military-industrial infrastructure.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[4]:438,675
The North Korean government learned some very hard lessons from your bombing campaign of the 1950s and had been laboring ever since to create a subterranean system that would allow their people to wage another war from a secure location.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[5]:0,113
Their population was heavily militarized, marshaled to a degree of readiness that made Israel look like Iceland.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[5]:113,199
Over a million men and women were actively under arms with a further five in reserve.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[5]:199,378
That is over a quarter of the entire population, not to mention the fact that almost everyone in the country had, at some point in their lives, undergone basic military training.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[5]:378,521
More important than this training, though, and most important for this kind of warfare was an almost superhuman degree of national discipline.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[5]:521,691
North Koreans were indoctrinated from birth to believe that their lives were meaningless, that they existed only to serve the State, the Revolution, and the Great Leader.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[6]:0,71
This is almost the polar opposite of what we experienced in the South.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[6]:71,96
We were an open society.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[6]:96,110
We had to be.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[6]:110,149
International trade was our lifeblood.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[6]:149,277
We were individualists, maybe not as much as you Americans, but we had more than our share of protests and public disturbances.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[6]:277,400
We were such a free and fractured society that we barely managed to implement the Chang Doctrine 1 during the Great Panic.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[6]:400,473
That kind of internal crisis would have been inconceivable in the North.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[6]:473,636
They were a people who, even when their government caused a near genocidal famine, would rather resort to eating children 2 than raise even a whisper of defiance.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[6]:636,711
This was the kind of subservience Adolf Hitler could have only dreamed of.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[6]:711,907
If you had given each citizen a gun, a rock, or even their bare hands, pointed them at approaching zombies and said “Fight!” they would have done so down to the oldest woman and smallest tot.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[6]:907,998
This was a country bred for war, planned, prepared, and poised for it since July 27, 1953.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[6]:998,1161
If you were going to invent a country to not only survive but triumph over the apocalypse we faced, it would have been the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[7]:0,18
So what happened?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[7]:18,184
About a month before our troubles started, before the first outbreaks were reported in Pusan, the North suddenly, and inexplicably, severed all diplomatic relations.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[7]:184,440
We weren’t told why the rail line, the only overland link between our two sides, was suddenly closed, or why some of our citizens who’d been waiting decades to see long lost relatives in the North had their dreams abruptly shattered by a rubber stamp.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[7]:440,478
No explanation of any kind was given.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[7]:478,549
All we got was their standard “matter of state security” brush-off.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[8]:0,73
Unlike many others, I wasn’t convinced that this was a prelude to war.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[8]:73,150
Whenever the North had threatened violence, they always rang the same bells.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[8]:150,219
No satellite data, ours or the Americans, showed any hostile intent.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[8]:219,304
There were no troop movements, no aircraft fueling, no ship or submarine deployment.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[8]:304,409
If anything, our forces along the Demilitarized Zone began noticing their opposite numbers disappearing.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[8]:409,446
We knew them all, the border troops.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[8]:446,620
We’d photographed each one over the years, given them nicknames like Snake Eyes or Bulldog, even compiled dossiers on their supposed ages, backgrounds, and personal lives.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[8]:620,686
Now they were gone, vanished behind shielded trenches and dugouts.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[9]:0,46
Our seismic indicators were similarly silent.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[9]:46,199
If the North had begun tunneling operations or even massed vehicles on the other side of “Z,” we would have heard it like the National Opera Company.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[10]:0,102
Panmunjom is the only area along the DMZ where opposing sides can meet for face-to-face negotiations.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[10]:102,227
We share joint custody of the conference rooms, and our troops posture for each other over several meters of open courtyard.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[10]:227,272
The guards were changed on a rotating basis.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[10]:272,376
One night, as the North Korean detachment marched into their barracks, no replacement unit marched out.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[10]:376,397
The doors were shut.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[10]:397,427
The lights were extinguished.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[10]:427,455
And we never saw them again.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[11]:0,64
We also saw a complete halt to human intelligence infiltration.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[11]:64,140
Spies from the North were almost as regular and predictable as the seasons.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[11]:140,275
Most of the time they were easy to spot, wearing out-of-date clothes or asking the price of goods that they should have already known.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[11]:275,379
We used to pick them up all the time, but since the outbreaks began, their numbers had dwindled to zero.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[12]
What about your spies in the North?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[13]:0,99
Vanished, all of them, right about the same time all our electronic surveillance assets went dark.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[13]:99,189
I don’t mean there was no disturbing radio traffic, I mean there was no traffic at all.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[13]:189,261
One by one, all the civilian and military channels began shutting down.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[13]:261,469
Satellite images showed fewer farmers in their fields, less foot traffic in city streets, even fewer “volunteer” laborers on many public works projects, which is something that has never happened before.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[13]:469,548
Before we knew it, there wasn’t a living soul left from the Yalu to the DMZ.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[13]:548,689
From a purely intelligence standpoint, it appeared as if the entire country, every man, woman, and child in North Korea, had simply vanished.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[14]:0,86
This mystery only stoked our growing anxiety, given what we had to deal with at home.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[14]:86,143
By now there were outbreaks in Seoul, P’ohang, Taejon.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[14]:143,362
There was the evacuation of Mokpo, the isolation of Kangnung, and, of course, our version of Yonkers at Inchon, and all of it compounded by the need to keep at least half our active divisions along our northern border.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[14]:362,550
Too many in the Ministry of National Defense were convinced that the Pyongyang was just aching for war, waiting eagerly for our darkest moment to come thundering across the 38th Parallel.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[14]:550,609
We in the intelligence community couldn’t disagree more.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[14]:609,720
We kept telling them that if they were waiting for our darkest hour, then that hour had most certainly arrived.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[15]:0,57
Tae Han Min’guk was on the brink of national collapse.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[15]:57,126
Plans were being secretly drafted for a Japanese-style resettlement.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[15]:126,185
Covert teams were already scouting locations in Kamchatka.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[15]:185,303
If the Chang Doctrine hadn’t worked…if just a few more units had broken, if a few more safe zones had collapsed…
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[16]:0,71
Maybe we owe our survival to the North, or at least to the fear of it.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[16]:71,125
My generation never really saw the North as a threat.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[16]:125,243
I’m speaking of the civilians, you understand, those of my age who saw them as a backward, starving, failed nation.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[16]:243,314
My generation had grown up their entire lives in peace and prosperity.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[16]:314,448
The only thing they feared was a German-style reunification that would bring millions of homeless ex-communists looking for a handout.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[17]:0,357
That wasn’t the case with those who came before us…our parents and grandparents…those who lived with the very real specter of invasion hanging over them, the knowledge that at any moment the alarms might sound, the lights might dim, and the bankers, schoolteachers, and taxi drivers might be called to pick up arms and fight to defend their homeland.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[17]:357,469
Their hearts and minds were ever vigilant, and in the end, it was them, not us, who rallied the national spirit.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[18]:0,52
I’m still pushing for an expedition to the North.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[18]:52,87
I’m still blocked at every turn.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[18]:87,132
There’s too much work to do, they tell me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[18]:132,166
The country is still in shambles.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[18]:166,274
We also have our international commitments, most importantly the repatriation of our refugees to Kyushu….
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[18]:274,320
[Snorts.] Those Japsare gonna owe us big-time.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[19]:0,39
I’m not asking for a recon in force.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[19]:39,152
Just give me one helicopter, one fishing boat; just open the gates at Panmunjom and let me walk through on foot.

What if you trigger some booby trap?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[19]:189,203
they counter.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[19]:203,227
What if it’s nuclear?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[19]:227,329
What if you open the door to some underground city and twenty-three million zombies come spewing out?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[19]:329,369
Their arguments aren’t without merit.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[19]:369,403
We know the DMZ is heavily mined.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[19]:403,493
Last month a cargo plane nearing their airspace was fired on by a surface-to-air missile.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[19]:493,629
The launcher was an automated model, the type they’d designed as a revenge weapon in case the population had already been obliterated.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[20]:0,86
Conventional wisdom is that they must have evacuated to their subterranean complexes.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[20]:86,188
If that is true, then our estimates of the size and depth of those complexes were grossly inaccurate.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[20]:188,380
Maybe the entire population is underground, tooling away on endless war projects, while their “Great Leader” continues to anesthetize himself with Western liquor and American pornography.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[20]:380,415
Do they even know the war is over?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[20]:415,518
Have their leaders lied to them, again, and told them that the world as they know it has ceased to be?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[20]:518,667
Maybe the rise of the dead was a “good” thing in their eyes, an excuse to tighten the yoke even further in a society built on blind subjugation.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[20]:667,897
The Great Leader always wanted to be a living God, and now, as master not only of the food his people eat, the air they breathe, but the very light of their artificial suns, maybe his twisted fantasy has finally become a reality.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[20]:897,970
Maybe that was the original plan, but something went disastrously wrong.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[20]:970,1030
Look what happened to the “mole city” underneath Paris.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[20]:1030,1086
What if that occurred in the North on a national level?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[20]:1086,1231
Maybe those caverns are teeming with twenty-three million zombies, emaciated automatons howling in the darkness and just waiting to be unleashed.

All humans do.

However, if I understand your culture correctly, individualism is something to be encouraged.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[24]:333,425
You revere the “rebel,” the “rogue,” those who stand proudly apart from the masses.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[24]:425,469
For you, individuality is a badge of honor.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[24]:469,502
For us, it is a ribbon of shame.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[24]:502,610
We lived, particularly before the war, in a complex and seemingly infinite labyrinth of external judgments.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[24]:610,770
Your appearance, your speech, everything from the career you held to the way you sneezed had to be planned and orchestrated to follow rigid Confucian doctrine.

Some either have the strength, or lack thereof, to accept this doctrine.

/html/body/div/div[7]/p[24]:843,895
Others, like myself, chose exile in a better world.

I can’t speak for your educational system, or, indeed, for that of any other country, but ours was based almost entirely on fact retention.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[25]:142,323
From the day we first set foot in a classroom, prewar Japanese children were injected with volumes upon volumes of facts and figures that had no practical application in our lives.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[25]:323,420
These facts had no moral component, no social context, no human connection to the outside world.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[25]:420,501
They had no reason for existence other than that their mastery allows ascension.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[25]:501,579
Prewar Japanese children were not taught to think, we were taught to memorize.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[26]:0,94
You can understand how this education would easily lend itself to an existence in cyberspace.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[26]:94,245
In a world of information without context, where status was determined on its acquisition and possession, those of my generation could rule like gods.

/html/body/div/div[7]/p[26]:245,479
I was a sensei, master over all I surveyed, be it discovering the blood type of the prime minister’s cabinet, or the tax receipts of Matsumoto and Hamada, 1 or the location and condition of all shin-gunto swords of the Pacific War.

I didn’t have to worry about my appearance, or my social etiquette, my grades, or my prospects for the future.

When the crisis reached Japan, my clique, as with all the others, forgot our previous obsessions and devoted our energies entirely to the living dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[27]:151,257
We studied their physiology, behavior, weaknesses, and the global response to their attack upon humanity.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[27]:257,368
The last subject was my clique’s specialty, the possibility of containment within the Japanese home islands.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[27]:368,440
I collected population statistics, transport networks, police doctrine.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[27]:440,569
I memorized everything from the size of the Japanese merchant fleet, to how many rounds the army’s Type 89 assault rifle held.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[27]:569,603
No fact was too small or obscure.

I was the first to hack into Doctor Komatsu’s personal hard drive and read the raw data a full week before he presented his findings to the Diet.

/html/body/div/div[7]/p[27]:898,915
This was a coup.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[27]:915,983
It further elevated my status among those who already worshipped me.

/html/body/div/div[7]/p[28]
Doctor Komatsu first recommended the evacuation?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[29]:0,8
He did.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[29]:8,55
Like us, he’d been compiling the same facts.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[29]:55,124
But whereas we’d been memorizing them, he’d been analyzing them.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[29]:124,324
Japan was an overcrowded nation: one hundred and twenty-eight million people jammed into less than three hundred and seventy thousand square kilometers of either mountainous or overurbanized islands.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[29]:324,454
Japan’s low crime rate gave it one of the relatively smallest and most lightly armed police forces in the industrialized world.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[29]:454,504
Japan was pretty much also a demilitarized state.
====

Because of American “protection,” our self-defense forces had not seen actual combat since 1945.

Even those token troops who were deployed to the Gulf almost never saw any serious action and spent most of their occupation duty within the protected walls of their isolated compound.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[29]:790,895
We had access to all these bits of information, but not the wherewithal to see where they were pointing.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[29]:895,1051
So it took us all by complete surprise when Doctor Komatsu publicly declared that the situation was hopeless and that Japan had to be immediately evacuated.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[30]
That must have been terrifying.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[31]:0,12
Not at all!
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[31]:12,114
It set off an explosion of frenzied activity, a race to discover where our population might resettle.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[31]:114,277
Would it be the South, the coral atolls of the Central and South Pacific, or would we head north, colonizing the Kuriles, Sakhalin, or maybe somewhere in Siberia?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[31]:277,355
Whoever could uncover the answer would be the greatest otaku in cyber history.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[32]
And there was no concern for your personal safety?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[33]:0,15
Of course not.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[33]:15,63
Japan was doomed, but I didn’t live in Japan.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[33]:63,112
I lived in a world of free-floating information.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[33]:112,242
The siafu, 2 that’s what we were calling the infected now, weren’t something to be feared, they were something to be studied.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[33]:242,299
You have no idea the kind of disconnect I was suffering.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[33]:299,393
My culture, my upbringing, and now my otaku lifestyle all combined to completely insulate me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[33]:393,519
Japan might be evacuated, Japan might be destroyed, and I would watch it all happen from the safety of my digital mountaintop.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[34]
What about your parents?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:0,17
What about them?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:17,89
We lived in the same apartment, but I never really conversed with them.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:89,129
I’m sure they thought I was studying.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:129,225
Even when school closed I told them I still had to prepare for exams. They never questioned it.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:225,255
My father and I rarely spoke.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:255,355
In the mornings my mother would leave a breakfast tray at my door, at night she would leave dinner.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:355,422
The first time she didn’t leave a tray, I thought nothing of it.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:422,526
I woke up that morning, as I always did; gratified myself, as I always did; logged on, as I always did.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:526,573
It was midday before I started to feel hungry.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:573,645
I hated those feelings, hunger or fatigue or, the worst, sexual desire.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:645,679
Those were physical distractions.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:679,696
They annoyed me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:696,767
I reluctantly turned away from my computer and opened my bedroom door.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:767,776
No food.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:776,800
I called for my mother.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:800,811
No answer.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:811,890
I went into the kitchen area, grabbed some raw ramen, and ran back to my desk.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[35]:890,945
I did it again, that night, and again the next morning.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[36]
You never questioned where your parents were?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[37]:0,97
The only reason I cared was because of the precious minutes I was wasting having to feed myself.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[37]:97,149
In my world too many exciting things were happening.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[38]:0,28
What about the other otaku?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[38]:28,62
Didn’t they discuss their fears?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[39]:0,67
We shared facts not feelings, even when they started to disappear.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[39]:67,159
I’d notice that someone had stopped returning e-mail or else hadn’t posted for a while.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[39]:159,251
I’d see that they hadn’t logged on in a day or that their servers were no longer active.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[40]
And that didn’t scare you?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[41]:0,15
It annoyed me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[41]:15,104
Not only was I losing a source of information, I was losing potential praise for my own.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[41]:104,285
To post some new factoid about Japanese evacuation ports and to have fifty, instead of sixty, responses was upsetting, then to have those fifty drop to forty-five, then to thirty…
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[42]
How long did this go on for?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[43]:0,18
About three days.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[43]:18,169
The last post, from another otaku in Sendai, stated that the dead were now flowing out of Tohoku University Hospital, in the same cho as his apartment.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[44]
And that didn’t worry you?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[45]:0,15
Why should it?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[45]:15,88
I was too busy trying to learn all I could about the evacuation process.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[45]:88,166
How was it going to be executed, what government organizations were involved?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[45]:166,220
Would the camps be in Kamchatka or Sakhalin, or both?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[45]:220,310
And what was this I was reading about the rash of suicides that was sweeping the country?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[45]:310,353
3 So many questions, so much data to mine.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[45]:353,406
I cursed myself for having to go to sleep that night.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:0,38
When I woke up, the screen was blank.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:38,58
I tried to sign on.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:58,67
Nothing.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:67,86
I tried rebooting.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:86,95
Nothing.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:95,135
I noticed that I was on backup battery.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:135,150
Not a problem.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:150,204
I had enough reserve power for ten hours at full use.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:204,253
I also noticed that my signal strength was zero.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:253,278
I couldn’t believe it.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:278,377
Kokura, like all Japan, had a state-of-the-art wireless network that was supposed to be fail-safe.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:377,440
One server might go down, maybe even a few, but the whole net?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:440,475
I realized it must be my computer.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:475,489
It had to be.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:489,531
I got out my laptop and tried to sign on.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:531,542
No signal.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:542,614
I cursed and got up to tell my parents that I had to use their desktop.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:614,641
They still weren’t home.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:641,710
Frustrated, I tried to pick up the phone to call my mother’s cell.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:710,752
It was cordless, dependent on wall power.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:752,769
I tried my cell.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[46]:769,788
I got no reception.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[47]
Do you know what happened to them?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[48]:0,38
No, even to this day, I have no idea.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[48]:38,89
I know they didn’t abandon me, I’m sure of it.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[48]:89,184
Maybe my father was caught out at work, my mother trapped while trying to go grocery shopping.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[48]:184,272
They could have been lost together, going to or coming back from the relocation office.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[48]:272,302
Anything could have happened.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[48]:302,330
There was no note, nothing.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[48]:330,372
I’ve been trying to find out ever since.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:0,77
I went back into my parents’ room, just to make sure they weren’t there.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:77,103
I tried the phones again.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:103,124
It wasn’t bad yet.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:124,148
I was still in control.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:148,175
I tried to go back online.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:175,195
Isn’t that funny?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:195,285
All I could think about was trying to escape again, getting back to my world, being safe.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:285,294
Nothing.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:294,314
I started to panic.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:314,391
“Now,” I started to say, trying to command my computer by force of will.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:391,409
“Now, now, NOW!
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:409,414
NOW!
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:414,453
NOW!” I started beating the monitor.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:453,512
My knuckles split, the sight of my own blood terrified me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:512,591
I’d never played sports as a child, never been injured, it was all too much.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:591,646
I picked up the monitor and threw it against the wall.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:646,700
I was crying like a baby, shouting, hyperventilating.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:700,752
I started to wretch and vomited all over the floor.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:752,794
I got up and staggered to the front door.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:794,861
I don’t know what I was looking for, just that I had to get out.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[49]:861,904
I opened the door and stared into darkness.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[50]
Did you try knocking at the neighbor’s door?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[51]:0,4
No.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[51]:4,22
Isn’t that odd?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[51]:22,145
Even at the height of my breakdown, my social anxiety was so great that actually risking personal contact was still taboo.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[51]:145,204
I took a few steps, slipped, and fell into something soft.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[51]:204,258
It was cold and slimy, all over my hands, my clothes.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[51]:258,268
It stank.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[51]:268,293
The whole hallway stank.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[51]:293,414
I suddenly became aware of a low, steady scraping noise, like something was dragging itself across the hallway toward me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[52]:0,59
I called out, “Hello?” I heard a soft, gurgling groan.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[52]:59,114
My eyes were just beginning to adjust to the darkness.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[52]:114,183
I began to make out a shape, large, humanoid, crawling on its belly.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[52]:183,273
I sat there paralyzed, wanting to run but at the same time wanting to…to know for sure.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[52]:273,355
My doorway was casting a narrow rectangle of dim gray light against the far wall.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[52]:355,498
As the thing moved into that light, I finally saw its face, perfectly intact, perfectly human, except for the right eye that hung by the stem.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[52]:498,574
The left eye was locked on mine and its gurgling moan became a choked rasp.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[52]:574,659
I jumped to my feet, sprang back inside my apartment, and slammed the door behind me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[53]
My mind was finally clear, maybe for the first time in years, and I suddenly realized that I could smell smoke and hear faint screams. I went over to the window and threw the curtains open.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[54]:0,29
Kokura was engulfed in hell.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[54]:29,82
The fires, the wreckage…the siafu were everywhere.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[54]:82,188
I watched them crash through doors, invade apartments, devour people cowering in corners or on balconies.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[54]:188,258
I watched people leap to their deaths or break their legs and spines.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[54]:258,352
They lay on the pavement, unable to move, wailing in agony as the dead closed in around them.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[54]:352,443
One man in the apartment directly across from me tried to fight them off with a golf club.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[54]:443,530
It bent harmlessly around a zombie’s head before five others pulled him to the floor.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:0,31
Then…a pounding at the door.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:31,40
My door.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:40,115
This…[shakes his fist] bom-bombom-bom…from the bottom, near the floor.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:115,151
I heard the thing groaning outside.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:151,205
I heard other noises, too, from the other apartments.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:205,317
These were my neighbors, the people I’d always tried to avoid, whose faces and names I could barely remember.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:317,373
They were screaming, pleading, struggling, and sobbing.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:373,494
I heard one voice, either a young woman or a child on the floor above me, calling someone by name, begging them to stop.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:494,544
But the voice was swallowed in a chorus of moans.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:544,582
The banging at my door became louder.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:582,607
More siafu had shown up.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:607,667
I tried to move the living room furniture against the door.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:667,693
It was a waste of effort.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:693,744
Our apartment was, by your standards, pretty bare.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:744,769
The door began to crack.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:769,803
I could see its hinges straining.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[55]:803,849
I figured I had maybe a few minutes to escape.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[56]:0,8
Escape?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[56]:8,37
But if the door was jammed…
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[57]:0,57
Out the window, onto the balcony of the apartment below.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[57]:57,196
I thought I could tie bedsheets into a rope…[smiles sheepishly]…I’d heard about it from an otaku who studied American prison breaks.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[57]:196,267
It would be the first time I ever applied any of my archived knowledge.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[58]:0,28
Fortunately the linen held.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[58]:28,115
I climbed out of my apartment and started to lower myself down to the apartment below.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[58]:115,156
Immediately my muscles started cramping.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[58]:156,237
I’d never paid much attention to them and now they were reaping their revenge.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[58]:237,335
I struggled to control my motions, and to not think about the fact that I was nineteen floors up.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[58]:335,390
The wind was terrible, hot and dry from all the fires.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[58]:390,459
A gust picked me up and slammed me against the side of the building.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[58]:459,511
I bounced off the concrete and almost lost my grip.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[58]:511,677
I could feel the bottom of my feet bumping against the balcony’s railing and it took all the courage I had to relax enough to climb down just those few extra feet.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[58]:677,734
I landed on my ass, panting and coughing from the smoke.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[58]:734,828
I could hear sounds from my apartment above, the dead that had broken through the front door.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[58]:828,971
I looked up at my balcony and saw a head, the one-eyed siafu was squeezing himself through the opening between the rail and the balcony floor.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[58]:971,1076
It hung there for a moment, half out, half in, then gave another lurch toward me and slid over the side.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[58]:1076,1255
I’ll never forget that it was still reaching for me as it fell, this nightmare flash of it suspended in midair, arms out, hanging eyeball now flying upward against its forehead.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[59]:0,122
I could hear the other siafu groaning on the balcony above and turned to see if there were any in this apartment with me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[59]:122,192
Fortunately, I saw that the front door had been barricaded like mine.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[59]:192,263
However, unlike mine, there weren’t any sounds of attackers outside.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[59]:263,319
I was also comforted by the layer of ash on the carpet.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[59]:319,427
It was deep and unbroken, telling me that no one or nothing had walked across this floor for a couple days.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[59]:427,497
For a moment I thought I might be alone, and then I noticed the smell.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[60]:0,82
I slid the bathroom door open and was blown back by this invisible, putrid cloud.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[60]:82,108
The woman was in her tub.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[60]:108,211
She had slit her wrists, long, vertical slices along the arteries to make sure the job was done right.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[60]:211,231
Her name was Reiko.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[60]:231,288
She was the only neighbor I’d made any effort to know.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[60]:288,353
She was a high-priced hostess at a club for foreign businessmen.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[60]:353,413
I’d always fantasized about what she’d look like naked.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[60]:413,424
Now I knew.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[61]:0,91
Strangely enough, what bothered me most was that I didn’t know any prayers for the dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[61]:91,197
I’d forgotten what my grandparents had tried to teach me as a little kid, rejected it as obsolete data.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[61]:197,254
It was a shame, how out of touch I was with my heritage.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[61]:254,360
All I could do was stand there like an idiot and whisper an awkward apology for taking some of her sheets.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[62]
Her sheets?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[63]:0,15
For more rope.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[63]:15,61
I knew I couldn’t stay there for very long.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[63]:61,203
Besides the health hazard of a dead body, there was no telling when the siafu on that floor would sense my presence and attack the barricade.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[63]:203,312
I had to get out of this building, get out of the city, and hopefully try to find a way to get out of Japan.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[63]:312,358
I didn’t have a fully thought-out plan yet.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[63]:358,440
I just knew I had to keep going, one floor at a time, until I reached the street.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[63]:440,700
I figured stopping at a few of the apartments would give me a chance to gather supplies, and as dangerous as my sheet-rope method was, it couldn’t be any worse than the siafu that would almost certainly be lurking in the building’s hallways and stairwells.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[64]
Wouldn’t it be more dangerous once you reached the streets?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[65]:0,11
No, safer.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[65]:11,50
[Catches my expression.] No, honestly.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[65]:50,99
That was one of the things I’d learned online.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[65]:99,161
The living dead were slow and easy to outrun or even outwalk.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[65]:161,281
Indoors, I might run the risk of being trapped in some narrow choke point, but out in the open, I had infinite options.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[65]:281,420
Better still, I’d learned from online survivor reports that the chaos of a full-blown outbreak could actually work to one’s advantage.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[65]:420,525
With so many other frightened, disorganized humans to distract the siafu, why would they even notice me?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[65]:525,757
As long as I watched my step, kept up a brisk pace, and didn’t have the misfortune to be hit by a fleeing motorist or stray bullet, I figured I had a pretty good chance of navigating my way through the chaos on the streets below.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[65]:757,792
The real problem was getting there.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[66]:0,71
It took me three days to make it all the way down to the ground floor.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[66]:71,130
This was partially due to my disgraceful physical stamina.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[66]:130,244
A trained athlete would have found my makeshift rope antics a challenge so you can imagine what they were for me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[66]:244,375
In retrospect it’s a miracle I didn’t plunge to my death or succumb to infection with all the scrapes and scratches I endured.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[66]:375,438
My body was held together with adrenaline and pain medication.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[66]:438,489
I was exhausted, nervous, horribly sleep deprived.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[66]:489,534
I couldn’t rest in the conventional sense.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[66]:534,705
Once it got dark I would move everything I could against the door, then sit in a corner, crying, nursing my wounds, and cursing my frailty until the sky began to lighten.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[66]:705,878
I did manage to close my eyes one night, even drift off to sleep for a few minutes, but then the banging of a siafu against the front door sent me scurrying out the window.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[66]:878,960
I spent the remainder of that night huddled on the balcony of the next apartment.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[66]:960,1046
Its sliding glass door was locked and I just didn’t have the strength to kick it in.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[67]:0,161
My second delay was mental, not physical, specifically my otaku’s obsessive-compulsive drive to find just the right survival gear, no matter how long it took.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[67]:161,253
My online searches had taught me all about the right weapons, clothing, food, and medicine.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[67]:253,325
The problem was finding them in an apartment complex of urban salarymen.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[68]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[69]
[Laughs.]
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[70]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[71]:0,148
I made quite a sight, shimmying down that sheet-rope in a businessman’s raincoat and Reiko’s bright, pink, vintage “Hello Kitty” schoolbag.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[71]:148,265
It had taken a long time, but by the third day I had almost everything I needed, everything except a reliable weapon.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[72]
There wasn’t anything?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[73]:0,82
[Smiles.] This was not America, where there used to be more firearms than people.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[73]:82,181
True fact—an otaku in Kobe hacked this information directly from your National Rifle Association.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[74]
I meant a hand tool, a hammer, a crowbar…
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[75]:0,46
What salaryman does his own home maintenance?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[75]:46,155
I thought of a golf club—there were many of those—but I saw what the man across the way had tried to do.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[75]:155,274
I did find an aluminum baseball bat, but it had seen so much action that it was too bent out of shape to be effective.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[75]:274,390
I looked everywhere, believe me, but there was nothing hard or strong or sharp enough I could use to defend myself.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[75]:390,532
I also reasoned that once I made it to the street, I might have better luck—a truncheon from a dead policeman or even a soldier’s firearm.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[76]:0,51
Those were the thoughts that almost got me killed.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[76]:51,128
I was four floors from the ground, almost, literally, at the end of my rope.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[76]:128,231
Each section I made extended for several floors, just enough length to allow me to gather more sheets.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[76]:231,267
This time I knew would be the last.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[76]:267,649
By now I had my entire escape plan worked out: land on the fourth-floor balcony, break into the apartment for a new set of sheets (I’d given up looking for a weapon by then), slide down to the sidewalk, steal the most convenient motorcycle (even though I had no idea how to ride one), streaking off like some old-timey bosozoku, 4 and maybe even grab a girl or two along the way.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[76]:649,704
[Laughs.] My mind was barely functional by that point.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[76]:704,846
If even the first part of the plan had worked and I did manage to make it to the ground in that state…well, what matters is that I didn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[77]:0,114
I landed on the fourth-floor balcony, reached for the sliding door, and looked up right into the face of a siafu.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[77]:114,168
It was a young man, midtwenties, wearing a torn suit.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[77]:168,247
His nose had been bitten off, and he dragged his bloody face across the glass.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[77]:247,313
I jumped back, grabbed on to my rope, and tried to climb back up.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[77]:313,405
My arms wouldn’t respond, no pain, no burning—I mean they had just reached their limit.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[77]:405,470
The siafu began howling and beating his fists against the glass.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[77]:470,621
In desperation, I tried to swing myself from side to side, hoping to maybe rappel against the side of the building and land on the balcony next to me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[77]:621,676
The glass shattered and the siafu charged for my legs.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[77]:676,785
I pushed off from the building, letting go of the rope and launching myself with all my might…and I missed.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[78]:0,106
The only reason we are speaking now is that my diagonal fall carried me onto the balcony below my target.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[78]:106,190
I landed on my feet, stumbled forward, and almost went toppling off the other side.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[78]:190,265
I stumbled into the apartment and immediately looked around for any siafu.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[78]:265,375
The living room was empty, the only piece of furniture a small traditional table propped up against the door.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[78]:375,433
The occupant must have committed suicide like the others.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[78]:433,524
I didn’t smell anything foul so I guessed he must have thrown himself out of the window.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[78]:524,646
I reasoned that I was alone, and just this small measure of relief was enough to cause my legs to give out from under me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[78]:646,717
I slumped against the living room wall, almost delirious with fatigue.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[78]:717,801
I found myself looking at a collection of photographs decorating the opposite wall.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[78]:801,892
The apartment’s owner had been an old man, and the photographs told of a very rich life.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[78]:892,1016
He’d had a large family, many friends, and had traveled to what seemed every exciting and exotic locale around the world.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[78]:1016,1104
I’d never even imagined leaving my bedroom, let alone even leading that kind of life.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[78]:1104,1208
I promised myself that if I ever made it out of this nightmare, I wouldn’t just survive, I would live!
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[79]:0,92
My eyes fell on the only other item in the room, a Kami Dana, or traditional Shinto shrine.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[79]:92,157
Something was on the floor beneath it, I guessed a suicide note.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[79]:157,205
The wind must have blown it off when I entered.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[79]:205,250
I didn’t feel right just leaving it there.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[79]:250,303
I hobbled across the room and stooped to pick it up.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[79]:303,353
Many Kami Dana have a small mirror in the center.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[79]:353,437
My eye caught a reflection in that mirror of something shambling out of the bedroom.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[80]:0,51
The adrenaline kicked in just as I wheeled around.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[80]:51,162
The old man was still there, the bandage on his face telling me that he must have reanimated not too long ago.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[80]:162,187
He came at me; I ducked.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[80]:187,252
My legs were still shaky and he managed to catch me by the hair.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[80]:252,286
I twisted, trying to free myself.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[80]:286,316
He pulled my face toward his.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[80]:316,396
He was surprisingly fit for his age, muscle equal to, if not superior to, mine.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[80]:396,487
His bones were brittle though, and I heard them crack as I grabbed the arm that caught me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[80]:487,582
I kicked him in the chest, he flew back, his broken arm was still clutching a tuft of my hair.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[80]:582,661
He knocked against the wall, photographs falling and showering him with glass.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[80]:661,694
He snarled and came at me again.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[80]:694,753
I backed up, tensed, then grabbed him by his one good arm.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[80]:753,956
I jammed it into his back, clamped my other hand around the back of his neck, and with a roaring sound I didn’t even know I could make, I shoved him, ran him, right onto the balcony and over the side.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[80]:956,1054
He landed face up on the pavement, his head still hissing up at me from his otherwise broken body.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[81]:0,88
Suddenly there was a pounding on the front door, more siafu that’d heard our scuffle.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[81]:88,126
I was operating on full instinct now.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[81]:126,205
I raced into the old man’s bedroom and began ripping the sheets off his bed.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[81]:205,334
I figured it wouldn’t take too many, just three more stories and then…then I stopped, frozen, as motionless as a photograph.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[81]:334,435
That’s what had caught my attention, one last photograph that was on the bare wall in his bedroom.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[81]:435,500
It was black and white, grainy, and showed a traditional family.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[81]:500,609
There was a mother, father, a little boy, and what I guessed had to be the old man as a teenager in uniform.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[81]:609,676
Something was in his hand, something that almost stopped my heart.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[81]:676,754
I bowed to the man in the photograph and said an almost tearful “Arigato.”
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[82]
What was in his hand?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[83]:0,146
I found it at the bottom of a chest in his bedroom, underneath a collection of bound papers and the ragged remains of the uniform from the photo.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[83]:146,393
The scabbard was green, chipped, army-issue aluminum and an improvised, leather grip had replaced the original sharkskin, but the steel…bright like silver, and folded, not machine stamped…a shallow, tori curvature with a long, straight point.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[83]:393,544
Flat, wide ridge lines decorated with the kiku-sui, the Imperial chrysanthemum, and an authentic, not acid-stained, river bordering the tempered edge.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[83]:544,597
Exquisite workmanship, and clearly forged for battle.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[84]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[85]:0,38
[I motioned to the sword at his side.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[85]:38,54
Tatsumi smiles.]
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[86]
KYOTO, JAPAN
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[87]:0,79
[Sensei Tomonaga Ijiro knows exactly who I am seconds before I enter the room.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[87]:79,140
Apparently I walk, smell, and even breathe like an American.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[87]:140,292
The founder of Japan’s Tatenokai, or “Shield Society,” greets me with both a bow and handshake, then invites me to sit before him like a student.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[87]:292,386
Kondo Tatsumi, Tomonaga’s second in command, serves us tea then sits beside the old master.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[87]:386,486
Tomonaga begins our interview with an apology for any discomfort I might feel about his appearance.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[87]:486,558
The sensei’s lifeless eyes have not functioned since his adolescence.]
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[88]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[89]:0,87
I am “hibakusha.” I lost my sight at 11:02 A.M., August 9, 1945, by your calendar.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[89]:87,196
I was standing on Mount Kompira, manning the air-raid warning station with several other boys from my class.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[89]:196,284
It was overcast that day, so I heard, rather than saw, the B-29 passing close overhead.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[89]:284,376
It was only a single B-san, probably a reconnaissance flight, and not even worth reporting.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[89]:376,441
I almost laughed when my classmates jumped into our slit trench.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[89]:441,544
I kept my eyes fixed above the Urakami Valley, hoping to maybe catch a glimpse of the American bomber.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[89]:544,610
Instead, all I saw was the flash, the last thing I would ever see.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[90]:0,106
In Japan, hibakusha, “survivors of the bomb,” occupied a unique rung in our nation’s social ladder.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[90]:106,207
We were treated with sympathy and sorrow: victims and heroes and symbols for every political agenda.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[90]:207,275
And yet, as human beings, we were little more than social outcasts.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[90]:275,322
No family would allow their child to marry us.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[90]:322,399
Hibakusha were unclean, blood in Japan’s otherwise pristine genetic onsen.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[90]:399,447
1 I felt this shame on a deeply personal level.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[90]:447,512
Not only was I hibakusha, but my blindness also made me a burden.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[91]:0,99
Out the sanatorium’s windows I could hear the sounds of our nation struggling to rebuild itself.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[91]:99,152
And what was my contribution to this effort, nothing!
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[92]:0,109
So many times I tried inquiring about some manner of employment, some work no matter how small or demeaning.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[92]:109,131
No one would have me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[92]:131,204
I was still hibakusha, and I learned so many polite ways to be rejected.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[92]:204,360
My brother begged me to come and stay with him, insisting that he and his wife would take care of me and even find some “useful” task around the house.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[92]:360,408
For me that was even worse than the sanatorium.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[92]:408,489
He had just gotten back from the army and they were trying to have another baby.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[92]:489,539
To impose on them at such a time was unthinkable.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[92]:539,583
Of course, I considered ending my own life.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[92]:583,622
I even attempted it on many occasions.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[92]:622,712
Something prevented me, staying my hand each time I groped for the pills or broken glass.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[92]:712,763
I reasoned it was weakness, what else could it be?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[92]:763,819
A hibakusha, a parasite, and now a dishonorable coward.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[92]:819,863
There was no end to my shame in those days.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[92]:863,969
As the emperor had said in his surrender speech to our people, I was truly “enduring the unendurable.”
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[93]:0,52
I left the sanatorium without informing my brother.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[93]:52,167
I didn’t know where I was heading, only that I had to get as far from my life, my memories, myself, as possible.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[93]:167,279
I traveled, begged mostly…I had no more honor to lose…until I settled in Sapporo on the island of Hokkaido.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[93]:279,476
This cold, northern wilderness has always been Japan’s least populated prefecture, and with the loss of Sakhalin and the Kuriles, it became, as the Western saying goes, “the end of the line.”
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[94]:0,48
In Sapporo, I met an Ainu gardener, Ota Hideki.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[94]:48,149
The Ainu are Japan’s oldest indigenous group, and even lower on our social ladder than the Koreans.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[95]:0,86
Maybe that is why he took pity on me, another pariah cast out by the tribe of Yamato.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[95]:86,150
Maybe it was because he had no one to pass his skills along to.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[95]:150,197
His own son had never returned from Manchuria.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[95]:197,325
Ota-san worked at the Akakaze, a former luxury hotel that now served as a repatriation center for Japanese settlers from China.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[95]:325,418
At first the administration complained that they had no more funds to hire another gardener.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[95]:418,457
Ota-san paid me out of his own pocket.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[95]:457,538
He was my teacher and only friend, and when he died, I considered following him.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[95]:538,597
But, coward that I was, I could not bring myself to do it.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[95]:597,789
Instead I simply continued to exist, working silently in the earth as the Akakaze went from a repatriation center to a luxury hotel and Japan went from conquered rubble to economic superpower.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[96]:0,80
I was still working at the Akakaze when I heard of the first domestic outbreak.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[96]:80,211
I was trimming the Western-style hedges near the restaurant, when I overheard several of the guests discussing the Nagumo murders.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[96]:211,323
According to their conversation, a man had slain his wife, then set upon the corpse like some kind of wild dog.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[96]:323,540
This was the first time I had heard the term “African rabies.” I tried to ignore it and get on with my work, but the next day there were more conversations, more hushed voices across the lawn and beside the pool.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[96]:540,634
Nagumo was old news compared to the much more serious outbreak at Sumitomo Hospital in Osaka.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[96]:634,694
And the next day there was Nagoya, then Sendai, then Kyoto.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[96]:694,744
I tried to push their conversations from my mind.

/html/body/div/div[7]/p[96]:744,835
I had come to Hokkaido to escape from the world, to live out my days in shame and ignominy.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[97]:0,147
The voice that finally convinced me of danger came from the hotel’s manager, a stiff, no-nonsense salaryman with a very formal manner of speech.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[97]:147,296
After the outbreak in Hirosaki, he held a staff meeting to try to debunk, once and for all, these wild rumors about dead bodies coming back to life.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[97]:296,413
I had only his voice to rely on, and you can tell everything about a person by what happens when he opens his mouth.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[97]:413,515
Mister Sugawara was pronouncing his words far too carefully, particularly his hard, sharp consonants.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[97]:515,660
He was overcompensating for a previously conquered speech impediment, a condition that only threatened to rise in the presence of great anxiety.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[97]:660,913
I had listened to this verbal defense mechanism before from the seemingly unflappable Sugawara-san, first during the ’95 quake, and again in ’98 when North Korea had sent a long-range, nuclear-capable “test missile” streaking over our homeland.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[97]:913,1039
Sugawara-san’s articulation had been almost imperceptible then, now it shrieked louder than the air-raid sirens of my youth.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[98]:0,48
And so, for the second time in my life, I fled.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[98]:48,172
I considered warning my brother, but so much time had passed, I had no idea how to reach him or even if he was still alive.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[98]:172,291
That was the last, and probably the greatest of all my dishonorable acts, the heaviest weight I will carry to my grave.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[99]:0,17
Why did you run?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[99]:17,47
Were you afraid for your life?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[100]:0,15
Of course not!
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[100]:15,42
If anything I welcomed it!
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[100]:42,196
To die, to finally be put out of my lifelong misery was almost too good to be true…What I feared was, once again, becoming a burden to those around me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[100]:196,410
To slow someone down, to take up valuable space, to put other lives in danger if they tried to save an old blind man who wasn’t worth saving…and what if those rumors about the dead returning to life were true?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[100]:410,517
What if I were to find myself infected and awake from death to threaten the lives of my fellow countrymen?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[100]:517,584
No, that was not going to be the fate of this disgraced hibakusha.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[100]:584,667
If I was to meet my death, it should be in the same manner as I had lived my life.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[100]:667,698
Forgotten, isolated, and alone.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[101]:0,78
I left at night and began hitchhiking south down Hokkaido’s DOO Expressway.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[101]:78,261
All I had with me was a water bottle, a change of clothes, and my ikupasuy, 2 a long, flat shovel similar to a Shaolin spade but which also served for many years as my walking stick.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[101]:261,1264
There was still a sizable amount of road traffic in those days—our oil from Indonesia and the Gulf was still flowing—and many truck drivers and private motorists were kind enough to give me a “ride.” With each and every one, our conversation turned to the crisis: “Did you hear that the Self Defense Force has been mobilized?”; “The government’s going to have to declare a state of emergency”; “Did you hear there was an outbreak last night, right here in Sapporo?” No one was sure what the next day would bring, how far the calamity would spread, or who would be its next victim, and yet, no matter whom I spoke to or how terrified they sounded, each conversation would inevitably end with “But I’m sure the authorities will tell us what to do.” One truck driver said, “Any day now, you’ll see, if you just wait patiently and don’t make a public fuss.” That was the last human voice I heard, the day before I left civilization and trekked into the Hiddaka Mountains.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[102]:0,45
I was very familiar with this national park.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[102]:45,203
Ota-san had taken me here every year to collect sansai, the wild vegetables that attract botanists, hikers, and gourmet chefs from all over the home islands.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[102]:203,384
As a man who often rises in the middle of the night knows the exact location of every item in his darkened bedroom, I knew every river and every rock, every tree and patch of moss.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[102]:384,512
I even knew every onsen that bubbled to the surface, and therefore never wanted for a naturally hot and cleansing mineral bath.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[102]:512,862
Every day I told myself “This is the perfect place to die, soon I will have an accident, a fall of some kind, or perhaps I will become ill, contract some sickness or eat a poisoned root, or maybe I will finally do the honorable thing and just stop eating altogether.” And yet, every day, I foraged and bathed, dressed warmly and minded my steps.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[102]:862,955
As much as I longed for death, I continued to take whatever measures necessary to prevent it.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[103]:0,70
I had no way of knowing what was happening to the rest of my country.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[103]:70,183
I could hear distant sounds, helicopters, fighter planes, the steady, high-altitude whine of civilian jetliners.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[103]:183,244
Perhaps I was wrong, I thought, perhaps the crisis was over.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[103]:244,350
For all I knew, the “authorities” had been victorious, and the danger was rapidly fading into memory.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[103]:350,609
Perhaps my alarmist departure had done nothing more than create a welcome job opening back at the Akakaze and perhaps, one morning, I would be roused by the barking voices of angry park rangers, or the giggles and whispers of schoolchildren on a nature hike.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[103]:609,742
Something did arouse me from my sleep one morning, but not a collection of giggling students, and no, it wasn’t one of them either.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[104]:0,84
It was a bear, one of the many large, brown higuma roaming the Hokkaido wilderness.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[104]:84,216
The higuma had originally migrated from the Kamchatka Peninsula and bore the same ferocity and raw power of their Siberian cousins.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[104]:216,297
This one was enormous, I could tell by the pitch and resonance of his breathing.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[104]:297,358
I judged him to be no more than four or five meters from me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[104]:358,391
I rose slowly, and without fear.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[104]:391,419
Next to me lay my ikupasuy.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[104]:419,555
It was the closest thing I had to a weapon, and, I suppose, if I had thought to use it as such, it might have made a formidable defense.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[105]
You didn’t use it.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[106]:0,19
Nor did I want it.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[106]:19,82
This animal was much more than just a random, hungry predator.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[106]:82,109
This was fate, I believed.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[106]:109,159
This encounter could only be the will of the kami.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[107]
Who is Kami?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[108]:0,14
What is kami.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[108]:14,91
The kami are the spirits that inhabit each and every facet of our existence.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[108]:91,163
We pray to them, honor them, hope to please them and curry their favor.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[108]:163,344
They are the same spirits that drive Japanese corporations to bless the site of a soon-to-be constructed factory, and the Japanese of my generation to worship the emperor as a god.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[108]:344,491
The kami are the foundation of Shinto, literally “The Way of the Gods,” and worship of nature is one of its oldest, and most sacred principles.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[109]:0,56
That is why I believed their will was at work that day.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[109]:56,129
By exiling myself into the wilderness, I had polluted nature’s purity.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[109]:129,239
After dishonoring myself, my family, my country, I had at last taken that final step and dishonored the gods.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[109]:239,333
Now they had sent an assassin to do what I had been unable to for so long, to erase my stink.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[109]:333,369
I thanked the gods for their mercy.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[109]:369,410
I wept as I prepared myself for the blow.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[110]:0,15
It never came.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[110]:15,88
The bear stopped panting then released a high, almost childlike whimper.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[110]:88,173
“What is wrong with you?” I actually said to a three-hundred-kilogram carnivore.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[110]:173,305
“Go on and finish me!” The bear continued to whine like a frightened dog, then tore away from me with the speed of hunted prey.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[110]:305,340
It was then that I heard the moan.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[110]:340,372
I spun, tried to focus my ears.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[110]:372,438
From the height of his mouth, I could tell he was taller than me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[110]:438,543
I heard one foot dragging across the soft, moist earth and air bubbling from a gaping wound in its chest.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[111]:0,71
I could hear it reaching out to me, groaning and swiping at empty air.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[111]:71,138
I managed to dodge its clumsy attempt and snatched up my ikupasuy.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[111]:138,199
I centered my attack on the source of the creature’s moan.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[111]:199,359
I struck quickly, and the crack vibrated up through my arms. The creature fell back upon the earth as I released a triumphant shout of “Ten Thousand Years!”
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[112]:0,63
It is difficult for me to describe my feelings at this moment.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[112]:63,187
Fury had exploded within my heart, a strength and courage that drove away my shame as the sun drives the night from heaven.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[112]:187,228
I suddenly knew the gods had favored me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[112]:228,297
The bear hadn’t been sent to kill me, it had been sent to warn me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[112]:297,422
I didn’t understand the reason right then, but I knew I had to survive until the day when that reason was finally revealed.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[113]:0,60
And that is what I did for the next few months: I survived.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[113]:60,139
I mentally divided the Hiddaka range into a series of several hundred chi-tai.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[113]:139,301
3 Each chi-tai contained some object of physical security—a tree or tall, flat rock—some place I could sleep in peace without the danger of immediate attack.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[113]:301,380
I slept always during the day, and only traveled, foraged, or hunted at night.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[113]:380,531
I did not know if the beasts depended on their sight as much as human beings, but I wasn’t going to give them even the most infinitesimal advantage.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[113]:531,532
4
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[114]:0,77
Losing my vision had also prepared me for the act of ever-vigilant mobility.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[114]:77,203
Those with sight have a tendency to take walking for granted; how else could they trip over something they’ve clearly seen?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[114]:203,324
The fault lies not in the eyes, but in the mind, a lazy thought process spoiled by a lifetime of optic nerve dependency.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[114]:324,350
Not so for those like me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[114]:350,464
I already had to be on guard for potential danger, to be focused, alert, and “watching my step,” so to speak.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[114]:464,516
Simply adding one more threat was no bother at all.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[114]:516,586
Every time I walked, it was for no longer than several hundred paces.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[114]:586,671
I would halt, listen to and smell the wind, perhaps even press my ear to the ground.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[114]:671,700
This method never failed me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[114]:700,746
I was never surprised, never caught off guard.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[115]
Was there ever a problem with long-range detection, not being able to see an attacker several miles away?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[116]:0,155
My nocturnal activity would have prevented the use of healthy eyesight, and any beast several kilometers away was no more a threat to me than I was to it.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[116]:155,325
There was no need to be on my guard until they entered what you might call my “circle of sensory security,” the maximum range of my ears, nose, fingertips, and feet.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[116]:325,463
On the best of days, when the conditions were right and Haya-ji 5 was in a helpful mood, that circle extended as far as half a kilometer.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[116]:463,555
On the worst of days, that range might drop to no more than thirty, possibly fifteen paces.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[116]:555,711
These incidents were infrequent at best, occurring if I had done something to truly anger the kami, although I can’t possibly imagine what that would be.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[116]:711,807
The beasts were a great help as well, always being courteous enough to warn me before attacking.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[117]:0,194
That howling alarm that ignites the moment they detect prey would not only alert me to the presence of an attacking creature, but even to the direction, range, and exact position of the attack.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[117]:194,350
I would hear that moan wafting across the hills and fields and know that, in perhaps half an hour or so, one of the living dead would be paying me a visit.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[117]:350,437
In instances such as these I would halt, then patiently prepare myself for the attack.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[117]:437,537
I would unclasp my pack, stretch my limbs, sometimes just find a place to sit quietly and meditate.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[117]:537,598
I always knew when they were getting close enough to strike.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[117]:598,678
I always took the time to bow and thank them for being so courteous to warn me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[117]:678,835
I almost felt sorry for the poor mindless filth, to come all this way, slowly and methodically, only to end their journey with a split skull or severed neck.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[118]
Did you always kill your enemy on the first strike?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[119]
Always.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[120]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[121]
[He gestures with an imaginary ikupasuy.]
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[122]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[123]:0,29
Thrust forward, never swing.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[123]:29,76
At first I would aim for the base of the neck.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[123]:76,154
Later, as my skills grew with time and experience, I learned to strike here…
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[124]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[125]
[He places his hand horizontally against the indentation between the forehead and nose.]
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[126]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[127]
It was a little harder than simple decapitation, all that thick tough bone, but it did serve to destroy the brain, as opposed to decapitation where the living head would always require a secondary blow.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[128]:0,31
What about multiple attackers?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[128]:31,58
Was that more of a problem?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[129]:0,23
Yes, in the beginning.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[129]:23,97
As their numbers swelled, I began to find myself increasingly surrounded.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[129]:97,191
Those early battles were…“untidy.” I must admit, I allowed my emotions to rule my hand.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[129]:191,234
I was the typhoon, not the lightning bolt.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[129]:234,317
During one melee at “Tokachi-dake,” I dispatched forty-one in as many minutes.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[129]:317,378
I was washing bodily fluids from my clothes for a fortnight.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[129]:378,484
Later, as I began to exercise more tactical creativity, I allowed the gods to join me on the battlefield.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[129]:484,587
I would lead groups of beasts to the base of a tall rock, where I would crush their skulls from above.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[129]:587,760
I might even find a rock that allowed them to climb up after me, not all at once, you understand, one by one, so I could knock them back into the jagged outcroppings below.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[129]:760,873
I was sure to thank the spirit of each rock, or cliff, or waterfall that carried them over thousand-meter drops.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[129]:873,938
This last incident was not something I cared to make a habit of.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[129]:938,991
It was a long and arduous climb to retrieve the body.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[130]
You went after the corpse?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[131]:0,12
To bury it.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[131]:12,70
I couldn’t just leave it there, desecrating the stream.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[131]:70,108
It would not have been…“proper.”
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[132]
Did you retrieve all the bodies?
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[133]:0,16
Every last one.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[133]:16,69
That time, after Tokachi-dake, I dug for three days.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[133]:69,249
The heads I always separated; most of the time I just burned them, but at Tokachi-dake, I threw them into the volcanic crater where Oyamatsumi’s 6 rage could purge their stench.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[133]:249,309
I did not completely understand why I committed these acts.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[133]:309,366
It just felt correct, to separate the source of the evil.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[134]:0,63
The answer came to me on the eve of my second winter in exile.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[134]:63,123
This would be my last night in the branches of a tall tree.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[134]:123,209
Once the snow fell, I would return to the cave where I had spent the previous winter.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[134]:209,369
I had just settled in comfortably, waiting for dawn’s warmth to lull me to sleep, when I heard the sound of footsteps, too quick and energetic to be a beast.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[134]:369,417
Haya-ji had decided to be favorable that night.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[134]:417,475
He brought the smell of what could only be a human being.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[134]:475,552
I had come to realize that the living dead were surprisingly bereft of odor.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[134]:552,766
Yes, there was the subtle hint of decomposition, stronger, perhaps, if the body had been turned for some time, or if chewed flesh had pushed through its bowels and collected in a rotting heap in its undergarments.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[134]:766,918
Other than this, though, the living dead possessed what I refer to as a “scentless stink.” They produced no sweat, no urine, or conventional feces.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[134]:918,1041
They did not even carry the bacteria within their stomach or teeth that, in living humans, would have fouled their breath.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[134]:1041,1121
None of this was true of the two-legged animal rapidly approaching my position.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[134]:1121,1202
His breath, his body, his clothes, all had clearly not been washed for some time.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[135]:0,43
It was still dark so he did not notice me.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[135]:43,127
I could tell that his path would take him directly underneath the limbs of my tree.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[135]:127,155
I crouched slowly, quietly.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[135]:155,223
I wasn’t sure if he was hostile, insane, or even recently bitten.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[135]:223,247
I was taking no chances.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[136]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[137]
[At this point, Kondo chimes in.]
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[138]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[139]:0,38
KONDO: He was on me before I knew it.
====
/html/body/div/div[7]/p[139]:38,92
My sword went flying, my feet collapsed from under me.

I ordered him to explain.

KONDO: I described everything, about the plague, the evacuation.

I cried when I told him that Japan had been completely abandoned, that Japan was nai.

/html/body/div/div[13]/p[3]:0,31
TOMONAGA: And suddenly I knew.
====
/html/body/div/div[13]/p[3]:31,177
I knew why the gods had taken my sight, why they sent me to Hokkaido to learn how to care for the land, and why they had sent the bear to warn me.

KONDO: He began to laugh as he let me up and helped to brush the dirt from my clothing.

“The view is breathtaking,” he promises.

“You will not be disappointed.” On the sixty-ninth floor of the Malpica Savings and Loans building, the second-tallest building in Cuba after Havana’s José Martí Towers, Señor Alvarez’s corner office overlooks both the glittering metropolis and bustling harbor below.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[6]:384,585
It is the “magic hour” for energy-independent buildings like the Malpica, that time of the day when it’s photovoltaic windows capture the setting sun with their almost imperceptible magenta hue.

Cuba won the Zombie War; maybe that’s not the most humble of statements, given what happened to so many other countries, but just look at where we were twenty years ago as opposed to where we are now.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[9]:0,102
Before the war, we lived in a state of quasi-isolation, worse than during the height of the cold war.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[9]:102,234
At least in my father’s day you could count on what amounted to economic welfare from the Soviet Union and their ComEcon puppets.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[9]:234,327
Since the fall of the communist bloc, though, our existence was one of constant deprivation.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[9]:327,531
Rationed food, rationed fuel…the closest comparison I can make is that of Great Britain during the Blitz, and like that other besieged island, we too lived under the dark cloud of an ever-present enemy.

blockade, while not as constricting as during the cold war, nonetheless sought to suffocate our economic lifeblood by punishing any nation that attempted free and open trade.

As successful as the U.S.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[10]:210,334
strategy was, its most resounding triumph was allowing Fidel to use our northern oppressor as an excuse to remain in power.

“The blockade has done this to you, the Yankees have done this to you, and without me, they would be storming our beaches even now!” He was brilliant, Machiavelli’s most favored son.

He knew we would never remove him while the enemy was at the gates.

Cases were small and immediately contained, mostly Chinese refugees and a few European businessmen.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[11]:100,225
Travel from the United States was still largely prohibited, so we were spared the initial blow of first-wave mass migration.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[11]:225,366
The repressive nature of our fortress society allowed the government to take steps to ensure that the infection was never allowed to spread.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[11]:366,468
All internal travel was suspended, and both the regular army and territorial militias were mobilized.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[11]:468,624
Because Cuba had such a high percentage of doctors per capita, our leader knew the true nature of the infection weeks after the first outbreak was reported.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[12]
By the time of the Great Panic, when the world finally woke up to the nightmare breaking down their doors, Cuba had already prepared itself for war.
====

The simple fact of geography spared us the danger of large-scale, overland swarms. Our invaders came from the sea, specifically from an armada of boat people.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[13]:159,325
Not only did they bring the contagion, as we have seen throughout the world, there were also those who believed in ruling their new homes as modern-day conquistadors.

Look at what happened in Iceland, a prewar paradise, so safe and secure they never found the need to maintain a standing army.

That could have been us, easily, had it not been for the example set by our brothers in the smaller Windward and Leeward Islands.

They first eradicated multiple outbreaks along their archipelago, then, with barely a moment to catch their collective breaths, repelled not only seaborne zombies, but an endless flood of human invaders, too.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[15]:329,382
They spilled their blood so that we did not have to.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[15]:382,715
They forced our would-be latifundista to reconsider their plans for conquest, and realize that if a few civilians armed with nothing but small arms and machetes could defend their homelands so tenaciously, what would they find on the shores of a country armed with everything from main battle tanks to radar-guided antiship missiles?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[16]
Naturally, the inhabitants of the Lesser Antilles were not fighting for the best interests of the Cuban people, but their sacrifices did allow us the luxury of setting our own terms. Any seeking sanctuary would find themselves greeted with the saying so common among Norteamericano parents, “While under my roof, you will obey my rules.”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[17]:0,213
Not all of the refugees were Yankees; we had our share from mainland Latin America, from Africa, and western Europe, Spain especially—many Spaniards and Canadians had visited Cuba either on business or holiday.

I had gotten to know a few of them before the war, nice people, polite, so different from the East Germans of my youth who used to toss handfuls of candy in the air and laugh while we children scrambled for it like rats.

The majority of our boat people, however, originated from the United States.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[18]:77,204
Every day more would arrive, by large ship or private craft, even on homemade rafts that brought an ironic smile to our faces.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[18]:204,441
So many of them, a total of five million, equal to almost half of our indigenous population, and along with all the other nationalities, they were placed under the jurisdiction of the government’s “Quarantine Resettlement Program.”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[19]:0,72
I would not go so far as to call the Resettlement Centers prison camps.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[19]:72,233
They could not compare to the lives suffered by our political dissidents; the writers and teachers…I had a “friend” who was accused of being a homosexual.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[19]:233,313
His stories from prison cannot compare to even the harshest Resettlement Center.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[20]:0,33
It was not easy living, however.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[20]:33,246
These people, no matter what their prewar occupation or status, were initially put to work as field hands, twelve to fourteen hours a day, growing vegetables in what had once been our state-run sugar plantations.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[20]:246,286
At least the climate was on their side.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[20]:286,342
The temperature was dropping, the skies were darkening.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[20]:342,374
Mother Nature was kind to them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[20]:374,405
The guards, however, were not.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[20]:405,475
“Be glad you’re alive,” they’d shout after each slap or kick.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[20]:475,535
“Keep complaining and we’ll throw you to the zombies!”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[21]:0,335
Every camp had a rumor about the dreaded “zombie pits,” the hole in which they’d throw the “troublemakers.” The DGI [the General Intelligence Directorate] had even planted prisoners in the general population to spread stories about how they personally witnessed men being lowered, headfirst, into the boiling lake of ghouls.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[21]:335,636
This was all just to keep everyone in line, you see, none of it was actually true…though…there were stories about the “Miami whites.” The majority of American Cubanos were welcomed home with open arms. I myself had several relatives living in Daytona who just barely escaped with their lives.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[21]:636,732
The tears of so many reunions in those early, frantic days could have filled the Caribbean Sea.

But that first wave of postrevolution immigrants—the affluent elite who had flourished under the old regime and who spent the rest of their lives trying to topple everything we’d worked so hard to build—as far as those aristos were concerned…I am not saying there is any proof that they were thrown to the ghouls by their fat, reactionary, Bacardi blanka drinking asses…But if they were, they can suck Batista’s balls in hell.

Rumors and threats were one thing, but physical action…push a people, any people too far, and you risk the possibility of revolt.

Five million Yankees, all rising in open revolution?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[25]:276,289
Unthinkable.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[25]:289,408
It already took too many troops to maintain the camps, and that was the initial success of the Yankee invasion of Cuba.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[26]:0,119
We simply didn’t have the manpower to guard five million detainees and almost four thousand kilometers of coastline.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[26]:119,160
We couldn’t fight a war on two fronts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[26]:160,316
And so the decision was made to dissolve the centers and allow 10 percent of the Yankee detainees to work outside the wire on a specialized parole program.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[26]:316,576
These detainees would do the jobs Cubanos no longer wanted—day laborers, dish washers, and street cleaners—and while their wages would be next to nothing, their labor hours would go to a point system that allowed them to buy the freedom of other detainees.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[27]:0,107
It was an ingenious idea—some Florida Cubano came up with it—and the camps were drained in six months.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[27]:107,200
At first the government tried to keep track of all of them, but that soon proved impossible.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[27]:200,327
Within a year they had almost fully integrated, the “Nortecubanos,” insinuating themselves into every facet of our society.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[28]
Officially the camps had been created to contain the spread of “infection,” but that wasn’t the kind spread by the dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[29]:0,80
You couldn’t see this infection at first, not when we were still under siege.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[29]:80,140
It was still behind closed doors, still spoken in whispers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[29]:140,299
Over the next several years what occurred was not so much a revolution as an evolution, an economic reform here, a legalized, privately owned newspaper there.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[29]:299,352
People began to think more boldly, talk more boldly.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[29]:352,399
Slowly, quietly, the seeds began to take root.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[29]:399,566
I’m sure Fidel would have loved to bring his iron fist crashing down on our fledgling freedoms. Perhaps he might have, if world events had not shifted in our favor.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[29]:566,660
It was when the world governments decided to go on the attack that everything changed forever.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[30]:0,142
Suddenly we became “the Arsenal of Victory.” We were the breadbasket, the manufacturing center, the training ground, and the springboard.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[30]:142,241
We became the air hub for both North and South America, the great dry dock for ten thousand ships.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[30]:241,426
1 We had money, lots of it, money that created an overnight middle class, and a thriving, capitalist economy that needed the refined skills and practical experience of the Nortecubanos.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[31]:0,53
We shared a bond I don’t think can ever be broken.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[31]:53,123
We helped them reclaim their nation, and they helped us reclaim ours.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[31]:123,255
They showed us the meaning of democracy…freedom, not just in vague, abstract terms, but on a very real, individually human level.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[31]:255,400
Freedom isn’t just something you have for the sake of having, you have to want something else first and then want the freedom to fight for it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[31]:400,454
That was the lesson we learned from the Nortecubanos.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[31]:454,568
They all had such grand dreams, and they’d lay down their lives for the freedom to make those dreams come true.

Although no one since the war has ever remotely questioned either his or his crew’s patriotism, he is taking no chances for the eyes of “foreign readers.” Initially defensive, he consents to this interview only on the condition that I listen objectively to “his” side of the story, a demand he clings to even after I explain that there is no other.]

All you need is a group of men, or women, give them matching clothes, a few hours training, something that passes for a weapon, and you have an army, not the best army, but still an army nonetheless.

With their vast stockpiles of conventional armaments, with their “bottomless well” of manpower…“bottomless well,” unforgivable.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[47]:224,293
Do you know why we had such a population explosion during the 1950s?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[47]:293,356
Because Mao believed it was the only way to win a nuclear war.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[47]:356,387
This is truth, not propaganda.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[47]:387,559
It was common knowledge that when the atomic dust eventually settled, only a few thousand American or Soviet survivors would be overwhelmed by tens of millions of Chinese.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[47]:559,768
Numbers, that was the philosophy of my grandparents’ generation, and it was the strategy the army was quick to adopt once our experienced, professional troops were devoured in the outbreak’s early stages.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[47]:768,910
Those generals, sick, twisted old criminals sitting safely in their bunker and ordering wave after wave of conscripted teenagers into battle.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[47]:910,977
Did they even think that every dead soldier was now a live zombie?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[47]:977,1222
Did they ever realize that, instead of drowning them in our bottomless well, we were the ones drowning, choking to death as the most populous nation on Earth found itself, for the first time in history, in danger of becoming fatally outnumbered?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[48]:0,49
That was what pushed Captain Chen over the edge.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[48]:49,158
He knew what would happen if the war continued along its course, and what our chances for survival would be.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[48]:158,266
If he thought that there was any hope, he would have grabbed a rifle and hurled himself at the living dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[48]:266,382
He was convinced that soon there would be no more Chinese people, and perhaps, eventually, no more people anywhere.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[48]:382,535
That was why he made his intentions known to his senior officers, declaring that we might be the only chance of preserving something of our civilization.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[49]
Did you agree with his proposal?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[50]:0,37
I didn’t even believe it at first.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[50]:37,80
Escape in our boat, our nuclear submarine?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[50]:80,178
This wasn’t just desertion, slinking out in the middle of a war to save our own pathetic skins.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[50]:178,253
This was stealing one of the motherland’s most valuable national assets.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[50]:253,380
The Admiral Zheng He was only one of three ballistic missiles subs and the newest of what the West referred to as the Type 94.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[50]:380,600
She was the child of four parents: Russian assistance, black-market technology, the fruits of anti-American espionage, and, let us not forget, the culmination of nearly five thousand years of continuous Chinese history.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[50]:600,706
She was the most expensive, the most advanced, the most powerful machine our nation had ever constructed.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[50]:706,794
To simply steal her, like a lifeboat from the sinking ship of China, was inconceivable.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[50]:794,918
It was only Captain Chen’s force of personality, his deep, fanatical patriotism that convinced me of our only alternative.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[51]
How long did it take to prepare?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[52]:0,14
Three months.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[52]:14,27
It was hell.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[52]:27,85
Qingdao, our home port, was in a constant state of siege.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[52]:85,271
More and more army units were called in to maintain order, and each was just a little less trained, a little less equipped, a little younger, or older, than the one that came before it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[52]:271,368
Some of the surface ship captains had to donate “expendable” crew to shore up base defenses.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[52]:368,417
Our perimeter was under attack almost every day.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[52]:417,491
And through all of this we had to prepare and provision the boat for sea.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[52]:491,613
It was supposed to be a routinely scheduled patrol; we had to smuggle on board both emergency supplies and family members.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[53]
Family members?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[54]:0,46
Oh yes, that was the cornerstone of the plan.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[54]:46,138
Captain Chen knew the crew wouldn’t leave port unless their families could come with them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[55]
How was that possible?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[56]
To find them or to smuggle them aboard?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[57]
Both.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[58]:0,28
Finding them was difficult.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[58]:28,84
Most of us had family scattered throughout the country.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[58]:84,208
We did our best to communicate with them, get a phone line working or send word with an army unit headed in that direction.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[58]:208,332
The message was always the same: we’d be heading back out on patrol soon and their presence was required at the ceremony.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[58]:332,425
Sometimes we’d try to make it more urgent, as if someone was dying and needed to see them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[58]:425,456
That was the best we could do.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[58]:456,521
No one was allowed to go out and physically get them: too risky.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[58]:521,588
We didn’t have multiple crews like you do on your missile boats.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[58]:588,625
Every rating would be missed at sea.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[58]:625,676
I pitied my shipmates, the agony of their waiting.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[58]:676,716
I was lucky that my wife and children…
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[59]:0,10
Children?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[59]:10,22
I thought…
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[60]:0,37
That we were only allowed one child?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[60]:37,161
That law was modified years before the war, a practical solution to the problem of an imbalanced nation of only-child sons.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[60]:161,183
I had twin daughters.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[60]:183,196
I was lucky.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[60]:196,263
My wife and children were already on base when the trouble started.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[61]:0,24
What about the captain?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[61]:24,43
Did he have family?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[62]:0,45
His wife had left him in the early eighties.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[62]:45,101
It was a devastating scandal, especially in those days.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[62]:101,182
It still astounds me how he managed to both salvage his career and raise his son.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[63]:0,14
He had a son?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[63]:14,35
Did he come with you?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[64]
[Xu evades the question.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[65]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[66]:0,169
The worst part for many others was the waiting, knowing that even if they managed to make it to Qingdao, there was a very good chance that we might have already sailed.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[66]:169,188
Imagine the guilt.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[66]:188,332
You ask your family to come to you, perhaps leave the relative safety of their preexisting hideout, and arrive only to be abandoned at the dock.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[67]
Did many of them show up?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[68]:0,34
More than one would have guessed.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[68]:34,150
We smuggled them aboard at night, wearing uniforms. Some—children and the elderly—were carried in supply crates.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[69]:0,42
Did the families know what was happening?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[69]:42,72
What you were intending to do?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[70]:0,22
I don’t believe so.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[70]:22,81
Every member of our crew had strict orders to keep silent.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[70]:81,189
Had the MSS even had a whiff of what we were up to, the living dead would have been the least of our fears.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[70]:189,268
Our secrecy also forced us to depart according to our routine patrol schedule.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[70]:268,393
Captain Chen wanted so badly to wait for stragglers, family members who might be perhaps only a few days, a few hours, away!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[70]:393,492
He knew it might have jeopardized everything, however, and reluctantly gave the order to cast off.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[70]:492,588
He tried to hide his feelings and I think, in front of most, he might have gotten away with it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[70]:588,664
I could see it in his eyes though, reflecting the receding fires of Qingdao.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[71]
Where were you headed?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[72]:0,85
First to our assigned patrol sector, just so everything would initially seem normal.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[72]:85,109
After that, no one knew.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[73]:0,66
A new home, at least for the time being, was out of the question.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[73]:66,133
By this point the blight had spread to every corner of the planet.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[73]:133,202
No neutral country, no matter how remote, could guarantee our safety.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[74]
What about coming over to our side, America, or another Western country?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[75]
[He flashes a cold, hard stare.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[76]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[77]:0,11
Would you?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[77]:11,143
The Zheng carried sixteen JL-2 ballistic missiles; all but one carried four multiple reentry warheads, with a ninety-kiloton yield.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[77]:143,280
That made her equivalent to one of the strongest nations in the world, enough power to murder entire cities with just the turn of a key.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[77]:280,407
Would you turn that power over to another country, the one country up until that point that had used nuclear weapons in anger?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[77]:407,459
Again, and for the last time, we were not traitors.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[77]:459,553
No matter how criminally insane our leadership might have been, we were still Chinese sailors.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[78]
So you were alone.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[79]:0,11
All alone.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[79]:11,78
No home, no friends, no safe harbor no matter how harsh the storm.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[79]:78,153
The Admiral Zheng He was our entire universe: heaven, earth, sun, and moon.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[80]
That must have been very difficult.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[81]:0,70
The first few months passed as though it was merely a regular patrol.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[81]:70,131
Missile subs are designed to hide, and that’s what we did.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[81]:131,148
Deep and silent.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[81]:148,214
We weren’t sure if our own attack subs were out looking for us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[81]:214,267
In all probability our government had other worries.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[81]:267,369
Still, regular battle drills were conducted and the civilians trained in the art of noise discipline.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[81]:369,508
The chief of the boat even rigged special soundproofing for the mess hall so it could be both a schoolroom and play area for the children.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[81]:508,583
The children, especially the younger ones, had no idea what was happening.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[81]:583,696
Many of them had even traveled with their families across infested areas, some barely escaping with their lives.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[81]:696,784
All they knew was that the monsters were gone, banished to their occasional nightmares.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[81]:784,836
They were safe now, and that’s all that mattered.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[81]:836,892
I guess that is how we all felt those first few months.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[81]:892,939
We were alive, we were together, we were safe.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[81]:939,1015
Given what was happening to the rest of the planet, what more could we want?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[82]
Did you have some way of monitoring the crisis?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:0,17
Not immediately.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:17,127
Our goal was stealth, avoiding both commercial shipping lanes and submarine patrol sectors…ours, and yours.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:127,150
We speculated, though.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:150,177
How fast was it spreading?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:177,217
Which countries were the most affected?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:217,254
Was anyone using the nuclear option?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:254,298
If so, that would be the end for all of us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:298,462
In a radiated planet, the walking dead might be the only creatures left “alive.” We weren’t sure what high doses of radiation would do to a zombie’s brain.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:462,553
Would it eventually kill them, riddling their gray matter with multiple, expanding tumors?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:553,712
That would be the case for a regular human brain, but since the living dead contradicted every other law of nature, why should this reaction be any different?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:712,952
Some nights in the wardroom, speaking in low voices over our off-duty tea, we conjured images of zombies as fast as cheetahs, as agile as apes, zombies with mutated brains that grew and throbbed and burst from the confines of their skulls.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:952,1081
Lieutenant Commander Song, our reactor officer, had brought aboard his watercolors and had painted the scene of a city in ruins.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:1081,1202
He tried to say that it wasn’t any city in particular but we all recognized the twisted remains of the Pudong skyline.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:1202,1233
Song had grown up in Shanghai.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:1233,1321
The broken horizon glowed a dull magenta against the pitch-black sky of nuclear winter.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:1321,1404
A rain of ash peppered the islands of debris that rose from lakes of melted glass.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:1404,1681
Snaking through the center of this apocalyptic backdrop was a river, a greenish-brown snake that rose up into a head of a thousand interconnected bodies: cracked skin, exposed brain, flesh dripping from bony arms that reached out from openmouthed faces with red, glowing eyes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:1681,1814
I don’t know when Commander Song began his project, only that he secretly unveiled it to a few of us after our third month at sea.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:1814,1860
He never intended to show it to Captain Chen.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:1860,1876
He knew better.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[83]:1876,1943
But someone must have talked and the Old Man soon put a stop to it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[84]:0,97
Song was ordered to paint over his work with something cheerful, a summer sunset over Lake Dian.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[84]:97,191
He then followed up with several more “positive” murals on any space of exposed bulkhead.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[84]:191,253
Captain Chen also ordered a halt to all off-duty speculation.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[84]:253,393
“Detrimental to the morale of the crew.” I think it pushed him, though, to reestablish some semblance of contact with the outside world.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[85]
Semblance as in active communication, or passive surveillance?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[86]:0,12
The latter.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[86]:12,114
He knew Song’s painting and our apocalyptic discussions were the result of our long-term isolation.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[86]:114,216
The only way to quell any further “dangerous thought” was to replace speculation with hard facts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[86]:216,284
We’d been in total blackout for almost a hundred days and nights.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[86]:284,379
We needed to know what was happening, even if it was as dark and hopeless as Song’s painting.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[87]:0,120
Up until this point, our sonar officer and his team were the only ones with any knowledge of the world beyond our hull.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[87]:120,258
These men listened to the sea: the currents, the “biologics” such as fish and whales, and the distant thrashing of nearby propellers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[87]:258,354
I said before that our course had taken us to the most remote recesses of the world’s oceans.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[87]:354,430
We had intentionally chosen areas where no ship would normally be detected.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[87]:430,539
Over the previous months, however, Liu’s team had been collecting an increasing number of random contacts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[87]:539,658
Thousands of ships were now crowding the surface, many of them with signatures that did not match our computer archive.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[88]:0,49
The captain ordered the boat to periscope depth.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[88]:49,163
The ESM mast went up and was flooded with hundreds of radar signatures; the radio mast suffered a similar deluge.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[88]:163,246
Finally the scopes, both the search and main attack periscopes, broke the surface.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[88]:246,360
It’s not like you see in the movies, a man flipping down the handles and staring through a telescopic eyepiece.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[88]:360,407
These scopes don’t penetrate the inner hull.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[88]:407,491
Each one is a video camera with its signal relayed to monitors throughout the boat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[88]:491,534
We couldn’t believe what we were seeing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[88]:534,596
It was as if humanity was putting everything they had to sea.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[88]:596,642
We spotted tankers, freighters, cruise ships.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[88]:642,762
We saw tugboats towing barges, we saw hydrofoils, garbage scows, bottom dredgers, and all of this within the first hour.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[89]:0,150
Over the next few weeks, we observed dozens of military vessels, too, any of which could have probably detected us, but none of which seemed to care.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[89]:150,177
You know the USS Saratoga?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[89]:177,261
We saw her, being towed across the South Atlantic, her flight deck now a tent city.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[89]:261,356
We saw a ship that had to be HMS Victory, plying the waves under a forest of improvised sails.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[89]:356,469
We saw the Aurora, the actual World War I–era heavy cruiser whose mutiny had sparked the Bolshevik Revolution.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[89]:469,580
I don’t know how they got her out of Saint Petersburg, or how they found enough coal to keep her boilers lit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[90]:0,254
There were so many beat-up hulks that should have been retired years ago: skiffs, ferries, and lighters that had spent their careers on quiet lakes or inland rivers, coastal crafts that should have never left the harbor for which they’d been designed.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[90]:254,407
We saw a floating dry dock the size of an overturned skyscraper, her deck now stuffed with construction scaffolding that served as makeshift apartments.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[90]:407,470
She was drifting aimlessly, no tug or support vessel in sight.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[90]:470,538
I don’t know how those people survived, or even if they survived.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[90]:538,623
There were a lot of drifting ships, their fuel bunkers dry, no way to generate power.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[91]:0,131
We saw many small private boats, yachts, and cabin cruisers that had lashed themselves together to form giant directionless rafts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[91]:131,196
We saw many purpose-built rafts as well, made from logs or tires.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[92]:0,123
We even came across a nautical shantytown constructed atop hundreds of garbage bags filled with Styrofoam packing peanuts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[92]:123,290
It reminded us all of the “Ping-Pong Navy,” the refugees who, during the Cultural Revolution, had tried to float to Hong Kong on sacks filled with Ping-Pong balls.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[93]:0,71
We pitied these people, pitied what could only be their hopeless fate.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[93]:71,342
To be adrift in the middle of the ocean, and prey to hunger, thirst, sunstroke, or the sea herself…Commander Song called it “humanity’s great regression.” “We came from the sea,” he would say, “and now we’re running back.” Running was an accurate term.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[93]:342,461
These people clearly hadn’t put any thought into what they would do once they reached the “safety” of the waves.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[93]:461,529
They just figured it was better than being torn apart back on land.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[93]:529,616
In their panic they probably didn’t realize they were just prolonging the inevitable.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[94]:0,31
Did you ever try to help them?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[94]:31,73
Give them food or water, maybe tow them…
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:0,10
To where?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:10,129
Even if we had some idea where the safe ports might have been, the captain wouldn’t dare take the risk of detection.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:129,202
We didn’t know who had a radio, who might be listening to that signal.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:202,251
We still didn’t know if we were a hunted boat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:251,317
And there was another danger: the immediate threat of the undead.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:317,452
We saw a lot of infested ships, some where the crews were still fighting for their lives, some where the dead were the only crew left.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:452,562
One time off Dakar, Senegal, we came across a forty-five-thousand-ton luxury liner called the Nordic Empress.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:562,734
Our search scope’s optics were powerful enough to see every bloody handprint smeared on the ballroom’s windows, every fly that settled on the deck’s bones and flesh.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:734,800
Zombies were falling into the ocean, one every couple of minutes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:800,933
They would see something in the distance, a low-flying aircraft, I think, or even the feather of our scope, and try to reach for it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:933,953
It gave me an idea.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:953,1109
If we surfaced a few hundred meters away, and did everything we could to lure them over the side, we might be able to clear the ship without firing a shot.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:1109,1174
Who knows what the refugees might have brought aboard with them?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:1174,1246
The Nordic Empress might turn out to be a floating replenishment depot.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[95]:1246,1331
I presented my proposal to the master at arms and together we approached the captain.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[96]
What did he say?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[97]:0,96
“Absolutely not.” There was no way of knowing how many zombies were onboard the dead liner.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[97]:96,194
Even worse, he motioned to the video screen and pointed to some of the zombies falling overboard.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[97]:194,264
“Look,” he said, “not all of them are sinking.” He was right.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[97]:264,372
Some had reanimated wearing life jackets, while others were beginning to bloat up with decomposition gases.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[97]:372,430
That was the first time I had ever seen a floating ghoul.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[97]:430,502
I should have realized then that they would become a common occurrence.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[97]:502,620
Even if 10 percent of the refugee ships were infested, that was still 10 percent of several hundred thousand vessels.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[97]:620,772
There were millions of zombies falling randomly into the sea, or else pouring in by the hundreds when one of those old hulks capsized in rough weather.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[97]:772,976
After a storm, they would blanket the surface to the horizon, rising waves of bobbing heads and flailing arms. Once we raised the search scope and were confronted with this distorted, greenish-gray haze.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[97]:976,1160
At first we thought it was an optical malfunction, as if we’d hit some floating debris, but then the attack scope confirmed that we’d speared one of them right under the rib cage.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[97]:1160,1231
And it was still struggling, probably even after we lowered the scope.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[97]:1231,1275
If ever something brought the threat home…
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[98]:0,25
But you were underwater?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[98]:25,42
How could they…
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[99]:0,61
If we surfaced and one was caught on deck, or on the bridge.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[99]:61,159
The first time I cracked the hatch, a fetid, waterlogged claw darted in and had me by the sleeve.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[99]:159,283
I lost my footing, fell onto the lookout below me, and landed on the deck with the severed arm still clamped to my uniform.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[99]:283,374
Above me, silhouetted in the bright disc of the open hatch, I could see the arm’s owner.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[99]:374,436
I reached for my sidearm, fired straight up without thinking.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[99]:436,480
We were showered in bone and bits of brain.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[99]:480,601
We were lucky…if any of us had had any kind of open wound…I deserved the reprimand I got, although I deserved worse.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[99]:601,675
From that point on, we always did a thorough scope sweep after surfacing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[99]:675,778
I would say that, at least one in every three instances, a few of them were crawling about on the hull.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[100]:0,93
Those were the observation days, when all we did was look and listen to the world around us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[100]:93,204
Besides the scopes we could monitor both civilian radio traffic and even some satellite television broadcasts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[100]:204,234
It wasn’t a pretty picture.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[100]:234,270
Cities were dying, whole countries.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[100]:270,370
We listened to the last report from Buenos Aires, the evacuation of the Japanese home islands, too.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[100]:370,439
We heard sketchy information about mutinies in the Russian military.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[100]:439,650
We heard after reports of the “limited nuclear exchange” between Iran and Pakistan, and we marveled, morbidly, at how we had been so sure that either you, or the Russians, would be the ones to turn the key.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[100]:650,735
There were no reports from China, no illegal or even official government broadcasts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[100]:735,836
We were still detecting naval transmissions, but all the codes had been shifted since our departure.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[100]:836,1048
While this presented something of a personal threat—we didn’t know if our fleet had orders to hunt down and sink us—at least it proved our whole nation hadn’t disappeared into the stomachs of the undead.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[100]:1048,1096
At this point in our exile any news was welcome.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[101]:0,91
Food was becoming an issue, not immediately, but soon enough to begin considering options.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[101]:91,241
Medicine was a bigger problem; both our Western-style drugs and various traditional herb remedies were beginning to run low because of the civilians.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[101]:241,280
Many of them had special medical needs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[102]:0,237
Mrs. Pei, the mother of one of our torpedo men, was suffering from chronic bronchial problems, an allergic reaction to something on the boat, the paint or perhaps machine oil, something you couldn’t simply remove from the environment.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[102]:237,294
She was consuming our decongestants at an alarming rate.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[102]:294,403
Lieutenant Chin, the boat’s weapons officer suggested, matter-of-factly, that the old woman be euthanized.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[102]:403,576
The captain responded by confining him to quarters, for a week, on half-rations, with all but the most life-threatening sickness to go untreated by the boat’s pharmacist.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[102]:576,672
Chin was a coldhearted bastard, but at least his suggestion brought our options into the light.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[102]:672,764
We had to prolong our supply of consumables, if not find a way of recycling them altogether.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[103]:0,48
Raiding derelicts was still strictly forbidden.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[103]:48,163
Even when we spotted what looked like a deserted vessel, at least a few zombies could be heard banging belowdecks.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[103]:163,335
Fishing was a possibility, but we had neither the material to rig any kind of net, nor were we willing to spend hours on the surface dropping hooks and lines over the side.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[104]:0,52
The solution came from the civilians, not the crew.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[104]:52,159
Some of them had been farmers or herbalists before the crisis, and a few had brought little bags of seeds.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[104]:159,308
If we could provide them with the necessary equipment, they might be able to start raising enough food to stretch our existing provisions for years.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[104]:308,368
It was an audacious plan, but not completely without merit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[104]:368,426
The missile room was certainly large enough for a garden.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[104]:426,594
Pots and troughs could be hammered out of existing materials, and the ultraviolet lamps we used for the crew’s vitamin D treatment could serve as artificial sunlight.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[105]:0,27
The only problem was soil.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[105]:27,127
None of us knew anything about hydroponics, aeroponics, or any other alternate agricultural method.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[105]:127,182
We needed earth, and there was only one way to get it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[105]:182,226
The captain had to consider this carefully.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[105]:226,334
Trying to deploy a shore party was as dangerous as, if not more than, attempting to board an infested ship.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[105]:334,434
Before the war, more than half of all human civilization lived at or near the world’s coastlines.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[105]:434,513
The infestation only increased this number as refugees sought to flee by water.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[106]:0,142
We began our search off the mid-Atlantic coast of South America, from Georgetown, Guyana, then down the coasts of Surinam, and French Guyana.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[106]:142,263
We found several stretches of uninhabited jungle, and at least by periscope observation, the coast appeared to be clear.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[106]:263,324
We surfaced and made a second, visual sweep from the bridge.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[106]:324,340
Again, nothing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[106]:340,395
I requested permission to take a landing party ashore.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[106]:395,430
The captain was not yet convinced.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[106]:430,496
He ordered the foghorn blown…loud and long…and then they came.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[107]:0,71
Just a few at first, tattered, wide-eyed, stumbling out of the jungle.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[107]:71,207
They didn’t seem to notice the shoreline, the waves knocking them over, pushing them back up on the beach or pulling them out to sea.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[107]:207,297
One was dashed against a rock, his chest crushed, broken ribs stabbing through the flesh.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[107]:297,398
Black foam shot from his mouth as he howled at us, still trying to walk, to crawl, in our direction.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[107]:398,489
More came, a dozen at a time; within minutes we had over a hundred plunging into the surf.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[107]:489,531
This was the case everywhere we surfaced.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[107]:531,676
All those refugees who’d been too unlucky to make it to the open ocean now formed a lethal barrier along every stretch of coastline we visited.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[108]
Did you ever try to land a shore party?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[109]:0,70
[Shakes his head.] Too dangerous, even worse than the infested ships.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[109]:70,141
We decided that our only choice was to find soil on an offshore island.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[110]
But you must have known what was happening on the world’s islands.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[111]:0,24
You would be surprised.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[111]:24,138
After leaving our Pacific patrol station, we restricted our movements to either the Atlantic or the Indian Ocean.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[111]:138,226
We’d heard transmissions or made visual observations of many of those specks of land.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[111]:226,326
We learned about the overcrowding, the violence…we saw the gun flashes from the Windward Islands.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[111]:326,418
That night, on the surface, we could smell the smoke as it drifted east from the Caribbean.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[111]:418,470
We could also hear islands that weren’t so lucky.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[111]:470,566
The Cape Verdes, off the coast of Senegal, we didn’t even see them before we heard the wails.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[111]:566,641
Too many refugees, too little discipline; it only takes one infected soul.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[111]:641,694
How many islands remained quarantined after the war?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[111]:694,772
How many frozen, northern rocks are still deeply and dangerously in the white?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[112]
Returning to the Pacific was our most likely option, but that would also bring us right back up to our country’s front door.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[113]:0,107
Again, we still did not know if the Chinese navy was hunting us or even if there was still a Chinese navy.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[113]:107,204
All we knew was that we needed stores and that we craved direct contact with other human beings.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[113]:204,247
It took some time to convince the captain.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[113]:247,306
The last thing he wanted was a confrontation with our navy.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[114]
He was still loyal to the government?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[115]:0,5
Yes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[115]:5,44
And then there was…a personal matter.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[116]:0,10
Personal?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[116]:10,14
Why?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[117]
[He skirts the question.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[118]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[119]
Have you ever been to Manihi?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[120]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[121]
[I shake my head.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[122]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[123]:0,73
You couldn’t ask for a more ideal image of a prewar tropical paradise.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[123]:73,167
Flat, palm-covered islands or “motus” form a ring around a shallow, crystal-clear lagoon.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[123]:167,256
It used to be one of the few places on Earth where they cultured authentic black pearls.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[123]:256,402
I had bought a pair for my wife when we visited Tuamotus for our honeymoon, so my firsthand knowledge made this atoll the most likely destination.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[124]:0,63
Manihi had changed utterly since I was a newly married ensign.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[124]:63,175
The pearls were gone, the oysters were eaten, and the lagoon was crowded with hundreds of small, private boats.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[124]:175,245
The motus themselves were paved with either tents or ramshackle huts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[124]:245,402
Dozens of improvised canoes either sailed or rowed back and forth between the outer reef and the dozen or so large ships that were anchored in deeper water.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[124]:402,586
The whole scene was typical of what, I guess, postwar historians are now calling “the Pacific Continent,” the refugee island culture that stretched from Palau to French Polynesia.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[124]:586,697
It was a new society, a new nation, refugees from all over the world uniting under the common flag of survival.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[125]
How did you integrate yourself into that society?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[126]:0,15
Through trade.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[126]:15,70
Trade was the central pillar of the Pacific Continent.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[126]:70,129
If your boat had a large distillery, you sold fresh water.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[126]:129,178
If it had a machine shop, you became a mechanic.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[126]:178,267
The Madrid Spirit, a liquefied natural gas carrier, sold its cargo off for cooking fuel.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[126]:267,404
That was what gave Mister Song his idea for our “market niche.” He was Commander Song’s father, a hedge-fund broker from Shenzhen.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[126]:404,522
He came up with the idea of running floating power lines into the lagoon and leasing the electricity from our reactor.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[127]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[128]
[He smiles.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[129]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[130]:0,144
We became millionaires, or…at least the barter equivalent: food, medicine, any spare part we needed or the raw materials to manufacture them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[130]:144,264
We got our greenhouse, along with a miniature waste recovery plant to turn our own night soil into valuable fertilizer.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[130]:264,395
We “bought” equipment for a gymnasium, a full wet bar, and home entertainment systems for both the enlisted mess and wardroom.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[130]:395,584
The children were lavished with toys and candy, whatever was left, and most importantly, continuing education from several of the barges that had been converted into international schools.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[130]:584,631
We were welcomed into any home, onto any boat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[130]:631,770
Our enlisted men, and even some of the officers, were given free credit on any one of the five “comfort” boats anchored in the lagoon.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[130]:770,783
And why not?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[130]:783,835
We lit up their nights, we powered their machinery.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[130]:835,916
We brought back long forgotten luxuries like air conditioners and refrigerators.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[130]:916,1016
We brought computers back online and gave most of them the first hot shower they’d had in months.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[130]:1016,1174
We were so successful that the island council even allowed us a reprieve, although we politely refused, from taking part in the island’s perimeter security.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[131]
Against seaborne zombies?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[132]:0,27
They were always a danger.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[132]:27,141
Every night they would wander up onto the motus or try to drag themselves up the anchor line of a low-lying boat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[132]:141,251
Part of the “citizenship dues” for staying at Manihi was to help patrol the beaches and boats for zombies.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[133]:0,28
You mentioned anchor lines.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[133]:28,59
Aren’t zombies poor climbers?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[134]:0,36
Not when water counteracts gravity.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[134]:36,104
Most of them only have to follow an anchor chain up to the surface.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[134]:104,241
If that chain leads to a boat whose deck is only centimeters above the water line…there were at least as many lagoon as beach attacks.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[134]:241,267
Nights were always worse.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[134]:267,311
That was another reason we were so welcome.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[134]:311,378
We could take back the darkness, both above and below the surface.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[134]:378,508
It is a chilling sight to point a flashlight at the water and see the bluish-green outline of a zombie crawling up an anchor line.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[135]
Wouldn’t the light tend to attract even more of them?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[136]:0,17
Yes, definitely.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[136]:17,91
Night attacks almost doubled once mariners began leaving their lights on.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[136]:91,170
The civilians never complained though, and neither did the island’s council.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[136]:170,281
I think that most people would rather face the light of a real enemy than the darkness of their imagined fears.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[137]
How long did you stay in Manihi?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[138]:0,16
Several months.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[138]:16,128
I don’t know if you would call them the best months of our lives, but at the time it certainly felt that way.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[138]:128,204
We began to let our guard down, to stop thinking of ourselves as fugitives.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[138]:204,316
There were even some Chinese families, not Diaspora or Taiwanese, but real citizens of the People’s Republic.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[138]:316,427
They told us that the situation had gotten so bad that the government was barely keeping the country together.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[138]:427,622
They couldn’t see how, when over half the population was infected and the army’s reserves were continuing to evaporate, they had the time or assets to devote any energy to find one lost sub.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[138]:622,784
For a little while, it looked as if we could make this small island community our home, reside here until the end of the crisis or, perhaps, the end of the world.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[139]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[140]
[He looks up at the monument above us, built on the very spot where, supposedly, the last zombie in Beijing had been destroyed.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[141]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[142]:0,57
Song and I had shore patrol duty, the night it happened.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[142]:57,123
We’d stopped by a campfire to listen to the islanders’ radio.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[142]:123,194
There was some broadcast about a mysterious natural disaster in China.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[142]:194,283
No one knew what it was yet, and there were more than enough rumors to keep us guessing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[142]:283,386
I was looking at the radio, my back to the lagoon, when the sea in front of me suddenly began to glow.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[142]:386,442
I turned just in time to see the Madrid Spirit explode.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[142]:442,609
I don’t know how much natural gas she still carried, but the fireball skyrocketed high into the night, expanding and incinerating all life on the two closest motus.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[142]:609,685
My first thought was “accident,” a corroded valve, a careless deckhand.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[142]:685,780
Commander Song had been looking right at it though, and he’d seen the streak of the missile.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[142]:780,839
A half second later, the Admiral Zheng’s foghorn sounded.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[143]:0,99
As we raced back to the boat, my wall of calm, my sense of security, came crashing down around me.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[143]:99,150
I knew that missile had come from one of our subs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[143]:150,265
The only reason it had hit the Madrid was because she sat much higher in water, presenting a larger radar outline.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[143]:265,291
How many had been aboard?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[143]:291,321
How many were on those motus?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[143]:321,425
I suddenly realized that every second we stayed put the civilian islanders in danger of another attack.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[143]:425,478
Captain Chen must have been thinking the same thing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[143]:478,555
As we reached the deck, the orders to cast off were sounded from the bridge.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[143]:555,608
Power lines were cut, heads counted, hatches dogged.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[143]:608,666
We set course for open water and dived at battle stations.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[144]:0,127
At ninety meters we deployed our towed array sonar and immediately detected hull popping noises of another sub changing depth.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[144]:127,230
Not the flexible “pop-groooaaan-pop” of steel but the quick “pop-pop-pop” of brittle titanium.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[144]:230,336
Only two countries in the world used titanium hulls in their attack boats: the Russian Federation and us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[144]:336,405
The blade count confirmed it was ours, a new Type 95 hunter-killers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[144]:405,451
Two were in service by the time we left port.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[144]:451,480
We couldn’t tell which one.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[145]
Was that important?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[146]
[Again, he does not answer.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[147]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[148]:0,40
At first, the captain wouldn’t fight.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[148]:40,139
He chose to bottom the boat, set her down on a sandy plateau at the bare limit of our crush depth.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[148]:139,199
The Type 95 began banging away with its active sonar array.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[148]:199,301
The sound pulses echoed through the water, but couldn’t get a fix on us because of the ocean floor.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[148]:301,406
The 95 switched to a passive search, listening with its powerful hydrophone array for any noise we made.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[148]:406,534
We reduced the reactor to a marginal output, shut down all unnecessary machinery, and ceased all crew movement within the boat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[148]:534,666
Because passive sonar doesn’t send out any signals, there was no way of knowing where the 95 was, or even if it was still around.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[148]:666,738
We tried to listen for her propeller, but she’d gone as silent as us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[148]:738,795
We waited for half an hour, not moving, barely breathing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[149]:0,107
I was standing by the sonar shack, my eyes on the overhead, when Lieutenant Liu tapped me on the shoulder.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[149]:107,203
He had something on our hull-mounted array, not the other sub, something closer, all around us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[149]:203,287
I plugged in a pair of headphones and heard a scraping noise, like scratching rats.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[149]:287,334
I silently motioned for the captain to listen.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[149]:334,361
We couldn’t make it out.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[149]:361,421
It wasn’t bottom flow, the current was too mild for that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[149]:421,521
If it was sea life, crabs or some other biologic contact, there would have to be thousands of them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[149]:521,637
I began to suspect something…I requested a scope observation, knowing the transient noise might alert our hunter.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[149]:637,657
The captain agreed.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[149]:657,703
We gritted our teeth as the tube slid upward.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[149]:703,719
Then, the image.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[150]:0,56
Zombies, hundreds of them, were swarming over the hull.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[150]:56,198
More were arriving each second, stumbling across the barren sand, climbing over each other to claw, scrape, actually bite the Zheng’s steel.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[151]:0,27
Could they have gotten in?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[151]:27,47
Opened a hatch or…
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[152]:0,97
No, all hatches are sealed from the inside and torpedo tubes are protected by external bow caps.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[152]:97,142
What concerned us, however, was the reactor.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[152]:142,181
It was cooled by circulating seawater.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[152]:181,276
The intakes, although not large enough for a man to fit through, can easily be blocked by one.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[152]:276,368
Sure enough, one of our warning lights began to silently flash over the number four intake.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[152]:368,451
One of them had ripped the guard off and was now thoroughly lodged in the conduit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[152]:451,499
The reactor’s core temperature began to rise.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[152]:499,541
To shut it down would leave us powerless.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[152]:541,582
Captain Chen decided that we had to move.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[153]:0,70
We lifted off the bottom, trying to be as slow and quiet as possible.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[153]:70,90
It wasn’t enough.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[153]:90,144
We began to detect the sound of the 95’s propeller.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[153]:144,190
She’d heard us and was moving in to attack.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[153]:190,274
We heard her torpedo tubes being flooded, and the click of her outer doors opening.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[153]:274,406
Captain Chen ordered our own sonar to “go active,” pinging our exact location but giving us a perfect firing solution on the 95.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[154]:0,27
We fired at the same time.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[154]:27,92
Our torpedoes passed each other, as both subs tried to get away.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[154]:92,206
The 95 was a little bit faster, a little more maneuverable, but the one thing they didn’t have was our captain.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[154]:206,335
He knew exactly how to avoid the oncoming “fish,” and we ducked them easily right about the time our own found their targets.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[155]:0,120
We heard the 95’s hull screech like a dying whale, bulkheads collapsing as compartments imploded one after the other.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[155]:120,296
They tell you it happens too fast for the crew to know; either the shock of the pressure change renders them unconscious or the explosion can actually cause the air to ignite.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[155]:296,365
The crew dies quickly, painlessly, at least, that’s what we hoped.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[155]:365,486
One thing that wasn’t painless was to watch the light behind my captain’s eyes die with the sounds of the doomed sub.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[156]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[157]
[He anticipates my next question, clenching his fist and exhaling hard through his nose.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[158]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[159]:0,183
Captain Chen raised his son alone, raised him to be a good sailor, to love and serve the state, to never question orders, and to be the finest officer the Chinese navy had ever seen.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[159]:183,307
The happiest day of his life was when Commander Chen Zhi Xiao received his first command, a brand-new Type 95 hunter-killer.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[160]
The kind that attacked you?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[161]:0,79
[Nods.] That was why Captain Chen would have done anything to avoid our fleet.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[161]:79,147
That was why it was so important to know which sub had attacked us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[161]:147,209
To know is always better, no matter what the answer might be.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[161]:209,347
He had already betrayed his oath, betrayed his homeland, and now to believe that that betrayal might have led him to murder his own son…
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[162]:0,104
The next morning when Captain Chen did not appear for first watch, I went to his cabin to check on him.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[162]:104,144
The lights were dim, I called his name.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[162]:144,262
To my relief, he answered, but when he stepped into the light…his hair had lost its color, as white as prewar snow.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[162]:262,300
His skin was sallow, his eyes sunken.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[162]:300,347
He was truly an old man now, broken, withered.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[162]:347,446
The monsters that rose from the dead, they are nothing compared to the ones we carry in our hearts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[163]:0,64
From that day on, we ceased all contact with the outside world.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[163]:64,151
We headed for the arctic ice, the farthest, darkest, most desolate void we could find.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[163]:151,300
We tried to continue with our day-to-day life: maintaining the boat; growing food; schooling, raising, and comforting our children as best we could.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[163]:300,384
With the captain’s spirit gone, so went the spirit of the Admiral Zheng’s crew.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[163]:384,439
I was the only one who ever saw him during those days.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[163]:439,582
I delivered his meals, collected his laundry, briefed him daily on the condition of the boat, then relayed his orders to the rest of the crew.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[163]:582,614
It was routine, day in, day out.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:0,115
Our monotony was only broken one day when sonar detected the approaching signature of another 95-class attack sub.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:115,203
We went to battle stations, and for the first time we saw Captain Chen leave his cabin.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:203,308
He took his place in the attack center, ordered a firing solution plotted, and tubes one and two loaded.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:308,369
Sonar reported that the enemy sub had not responded in kind.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:369,409
Captain Chen saw this as our advantage.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:409,457
There was no questioning in his mind this time.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:457,495
This enemy would die before it fired.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:495,617
Just before he gave the order, we detected a signal on the “gertrude,” the American term for an underwater telephone.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:617,736
It was Commander Chen, the captain’s son, proclaiming peaceful intentions and requesting that we stand down from GQ.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:736,857
He told us about the Three Gorges Dam, the source of all the “natural disaster” rumors we’d heard about in Manihi.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:857,975
He explained that our battle with the other 95 had been part of a civil war that the dam’s destruction had sparked.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:975,1038
The sub that attacked us had been part of the loyalist forces.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:1038,1080
Commander Chen had sided with the rebels.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:1080,1127
His mission was to find us and escort us home.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:1127,1191
I thought the cheer was going to carry us right to the surface.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:1191,1376
As we broke through the ice and the two crews ran to each other under the arctic twilight, I thought, finally, we can go home, we can reclaim our country and drive out the living dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[164]:1376,1397
Finally, it’s over.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[165]
But it wasn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[166]:0,42
There was still one last duty to perform.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[166]:42,252
The Politburo, those hated old men who had caused so much misery already, were still holed up in their leadership bunker in Xilinhot, still controlling at least half of our country’s dwindling ground forces.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[166]:252,384
They would never surrender, everyone knew this; they would keep their mad hold on power, squandering what was left of our military.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[166]:384,479
If the civil war dragged on any longer, the only beings left in China would be the living dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[167]
And you decided to end the fighting.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[168]:0,33
We were the only ones who could.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[168]:33,245
Our land-based silos were overrun, our air force was grounded, our two other missile boats had been caught still tied to the piers, waiting for orders like good sailors as the dead swarmed through their hatches.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[168]:245,343
Commander Chen informed us that we were the only nuclear asset left in the rebellion’s arsenal.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[168]:343,459
Every second we delayed wasted a hundred more lives, a hundred more bullets that could be thrown against the undead.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[169]
So you fired on your homeland, in order to save it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[170]:0,29
One last burden to shoulder.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[170]:29,101
The captain must have noticed me shaking the moment before we launched.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[170]:101,217
“My order,” he declared, “my responsibility.” The missile carried a single, massive, multi-megaton warhead.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[170]:217,343
It was a prototype warhead, designed to penetrate the hardened surface of your NORAD facility in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[170]:343,451
Ironically, the Politburo’s bunker had been designed to emulate Cheyenne Mountain in almost every detail.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[170]:451,549
As we prepared to get under way, Commander Chen informed us that Xilinhot had taken a direct hit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[170]:549,685
As we slid beneath the surface, we heard that the loyalist forces had surrendered and reunified with the rebels to fight the real enemy.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[171]
Did you know they had begun instituting their own version of the South African Plan?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[172]:0,53
We heard the day we emerged from under the ice pack.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[172]:53,135
That morning I came on watch and found Captain Chen already in the attack center.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[172]:135,195
He was in his command chair, a cup of tea next to his hand.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[172]:195,315
He looked so tired, silently watching the crew around him, smiling as a father smiles at the happiness of his children.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[172]:315,388
I noticed his tea had grown cold and asked if he would like another cup.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[172]:388,450
He looked up at me, still smiling, and shook his head slowly.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[172]:450,515
“Very good, sir,” I said, and prepared to resume my station.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[172]:515,596
He reached out and took my hand, looked up into, but did not recognize, my face.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[172]:596,643
His whisper was so soft I could barely hear it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[173]
What?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[174]
“Nice boy, Zhi Xiao, such a good boy.” He was still holding my hand when he closed his eyes forever.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[175]
SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[176]:0,127
[Clearwater Memorial is the newest hospital to be constructed in Australia and the largest one built since the end of the war.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[176]:127,405
Terry Knox’s room is on the seventeenth floor, the “Presidential Suite.” His luxurious surroundings and expensive, almost unobtainable medication are the least his government can do for the first and, to date, only Australian commander of the International Space Station.

In his words, “Not bad for the son of an Andamooka opal miner.”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[177]:0,58
His withered body seems to liven during our conversation.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[177]:58,94
His face regains some of its color.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[178]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[179]:0,57
I wish some of the stories they tell about us were true.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[179]:57,93
Makes us sound all the more heroic.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[179]:93,207
[Smiles.] Truth is, we weren’t “stranded,” not in terms of being suddenly or unexpectedly trapped up there.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[179]:207,263
Nobody had a better view of what was happening than us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[179]:263,409
No one was surprised when the replacement crew from Baikonur failed to launch, or when Houston ordered us to pile into the X-38 1 for evacuation.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[179]:409,512
I wish I could say that we violated orders or physically fought with one another over who should stay.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[179]:512,571
What really happened was much more mundane and reasonable.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[179]:571,715
I ordered the scientific team, and any other nonessential personnel, back to Earth, then gave the rest of the crew the choice to remain behind.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[179]:715,883
With the X-38 reentry “lifeboat” gone, we would be technically stranded, but when you think of what was at stake then, I can’t imagine any of us wanting to leave.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[180]:0,61
The ISS is one of the greatest marvels of human engineering.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[180]:61,160
We’re talking about an orbital platform so large it could be seen from Earth with the naked eye.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[180]:160,322
It’d taken sixteen countries over ten years, a couple hundred space walks, and more money than anyone without job security would admit to finally complete her.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[180]:322,398
What would it take to build another one, if another one could ever be built?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[181]:0,129
Even more important than the station was the incalculable, and equally irreplaceable, value of our planet’s satellite network.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[181]:129,361
Back then there were over three thousand in orbit, and humanity depended on them for everything from communications to navigation, from surveillance to something even as mundane yet vital as regular and reliable weather prediction.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[181]:361,488
This network was as important to the modern world as roads had been in ancient times, or rail lines during the industrial age.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[181]:488,584
What would happen to humanity if these all-important links just started dropping out of the sky?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[182]:0,37
Our plan was never to save them all.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[182]:37,75
That was unrealistic and unnecessary.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[182]:75,202
All we had to do was concentrate on the systems most vital to the war effort, just a few dozen birds that had to remain aloft.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[182]:202,243
That alone was worth the risk of staying.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[183]
Were you ever promised a rescue?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[184]:0,31
No, and we didn’t expect it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[184]:31,141
The issue wasn’t how we were going to get back to Earth, it was how we could manage to stay alive up there.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[184]:141,390
Even with all our tanked O2 and emergency perchlorate candles, 2 even with our water recycling system 3 operating at peak capacity, we only had enough food for roughly twenty-seven months, and that was including the test animals in the lab modules.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[184]:390,481
None of them were being used to test any kind of vaccines so their flesh was still edible.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[184]:481,576
I can still hear their little shrieks, still see the spots of blood floating in micro gravity.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[184]:576,624
Even up there, you couldn’t escape the blood.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[184]:624,748
I tried to be scientific about it, calculating the nutritional value of every floating red globule I sucked out of the air.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[184]:748,840
I kept insisting that it was all for the good of the mission and not my own ravenous hunger.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[185]:0,32
Tell me more about the mission.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[185]:32,119
If you were trapped on the station, how did you manage to keep the satellites in orbit?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[186]:0,106
We used the “Jules Verne Three” ATV, 4 the last supply pod launched before French Guyana was overrun.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[186]:106,261
It was originally designed as a one-way vehicle, to be filled with trash after depositing its cargo, then sent back to Earth to burn up in the atmosphere.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[186]:261,329
5 We modified it with manual flight controls and a pilot’s couch.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[186]:329,383
I wish we could have fixed it with a proper viewport.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[186]:383,556
Navigating by video wasn’t fun; neither was having to do my Extra Vehicular Activities, my space walks, in a reentry suit because there wasn’t room for a proper EVA kit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[187]:0,95
Most of my excursions were to the ASTRO, 6 which was basically just a petrol station in space.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[187]:95,204
Satellites, the military, surveillance type, sometimes have to change orbit in order to acquire new targets.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[187]:204,306
They do that by firing their maneuvering thrusters and using up their small amount of hydrazine fuel.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[187]:306,474
Before the war, the American military realized it was more cost-effective to have a refueling station already in orbit rather than sending up a lot of manned missions.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[187]:474,504
That’s where ASTRO came in.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[187]:504,665
We modified it to refuel some of the other satellites as well, the civilian models that need just the occasional top-off to boost back up from a decaying orbit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[187]:665,712
It was a marvelous machine: a real time-saver.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[187]:712,750
We had a lot of technology like that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[187]:750,889
There was the “Canadarm,” the fifty-foot robotic inchworm that performed necessary maintenance tasks along the station’s outer skin.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[187]:889,1041
There was “Boba,” the VR-operated robonaut we fitted with a thruster pack so he could work both around the station and away from it on a satellite.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[187]:1041,1152
We also had a little squadron of PSAs, 7 these free-floating robots, about the shape and size of a grapefruit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[187]:1152,1222
All of this wondrous technology was designed to make our jobs easier.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[187]:1222,1258
I wish they hadn’t worked so well.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[188]:0,75
We had maybe an hour a day, maybe even two, where there was nothing to do.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[188]:75,253
You could sleep, you could exercise, you could reread the same books, you could listen to Radio Free Earth or to the music we’d brought with us (over and over and over again).
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[188]:253,423
I don’t know how many times I listened to that Redgum song: “God help me, I was only nineteen.” It was my father’s favorite, reminded him of his time in Vietnam.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[188]:423,506
I prayed that all that army training was helping to keep him and my mum alive now.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[188]:506,611
I hadn’t heard anything from him, or anyone else in Oz since the government had relocated to Tasmania.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[188]:611,778
I wanted to believe they were all right, but watching what was happening on Earth, as most of us did during our off-duty hours, made it almost impossible to have hope.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[189]:0,115
They say that during the cold war, American spy birds could read the copy of Pravda in a Soviet citizen’s hands.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[189]:115,157
I’m not sure if that’s entirely true.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[189]:157,219
I don’t know the tech specs of that generation of hardware.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[189]:219,357
But I can tell you that these modern ones whose signals we pirated from their relay birds—these could show muscles tear and bones snap.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[189]:357,482
You could read the lips of victims crying out for mercy, or the color of their eyes when they bulged with their last breath.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[189]:482,616
You could see at what point red blood began to turn brown, and how it looked on gray London cement as opposed to white, Cape Cod sand.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:0,60
We had no control over what the spy birds chose to observe.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:60,102
Their targets were determined by the U.S.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:102,112
military.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:112,317
We saw a lot of battles—Chongqing, Yonkers; we watched a company of Indian troops try to rescue civilians trapped in Ambedkar Stadium in Delhi, then become trapped themselves and retreat to Gandhi Park.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:317,414
I watched their commander form his men into a square, the kind the Limeys used in colonial days.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:414,454
It worked, at least for a little while.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:454,553
That was the only frustrating part about satellite surveillance; you could only watch, not listen.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:553,670
We didn’t know that the Indians were running out of ammunition, only that the Zed Heads were starting to close in.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:670,758
We saw a helo hover overhead and watched as the commander argued with his subordinates.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:758,835
We didn’t know it was General Raj-Singh, we didn’t even know who he was.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:835,941
Don’t listen to what the critics say about that man, about how he buggered off when things got too hot.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:941,956
We saw it all.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:956,1053
He did try to put up a fight, and one of his blokes did smash him in the face with a rifle butt.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:1053,1117
He was out cold when they hauled him into that waiting chopper.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[190]:1117,1197
It was a horrible feeling, seeing it all so close and yet unable to do anything.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[191]:0,112
We had our own observation gear, both the civilian research birds and the equipment right there on the station.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[191]:112,230
The images they gave us weren’t half as powerful as the military versions, but they were still frighteningly clear.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[191]:230,326
They gave us our first look at the mega swarms over central Asia and the American Great Plains.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[191]:326,412
Those were truly massive, miles across, like the American buffalo must have once been.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[192]:0,80
We watched the evacuation of Japan and couldn’t help but marvel at the scale.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[192]:80,125
Hundreds of ships, thousands of small boats.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[192]:125,280
We lost count of how many helicopters buzzed back and forth from the rooftops to the armada, or how many jetliners made their final run north to Kamchatka.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[193]:0,124
We were the first ones to discover zombie holes, the pits that the undead dig when they’re going after burrowing animals.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[193]:124,309
At first we thought they were just isolated incidents until we noticed that they were spreading all over the world; sometimes more than one would appear in close proximity to the next.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[193]:309,478
There was a field in southern England—I guess there must have been a high concentration of rabbits—that was just riddled with holes, all different depths and sizes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[193]:478,527
Many of them had large, dark stains around them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[193]:527,606
Although we couldn’t zoom in close enough, we were pretty sure it was blood.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[193]:606,674
For me that was the most terrifying example of our enemy’s drive.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[193]:674,743
They displayed no conscious thought, just sheer biological instinct.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[193]:743,834
I once watched a Zed Head go after something, probably a golden mole, in the Namib Desert.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[193]:834,885
The mole had burrowed deep in the slope of a dune.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[193]:885,969
As the ghoul tried to go after it, the sand kept pouring down and filling the hole.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[193]:969,1041
The ghoul didn’t stop, didn’t react in any way, it just kept going.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[193]:1041,1230
I watched it for five days, the fuzzy image of this G digging, and digging, and digging, then suddenly one morning just stopping, getting up, and shuffling away as if nothing had happened.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[193]:1230,1259
It must have lost the scent.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[193]:1259,1276
Good on the mole.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[194]:0,81
For all our enhanced optics, nothing had quite the same impact as the naked eye.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[194]:81,154
To just look through the view port down on our fragile little biosphere.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[194]:154,294
To see the massive ecological devastation makes one understand how the modern environmental movement began with the American space program.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[194]:294,621
There were so many fires, and I don’t just mean the buildings, or the forests, or even the oil rigs blazing out of control—bleeding Saudis actually went ahead and did it 8 —I mean the campfires as well, what had to be at least a billion of them, tiny orange specks covering the Earth where electric lights had once been.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[194]:621,690
Every day, every night, it seemed like the whole planet was burning.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[194]:690,945
We couldn’t even begin to calculate the ash count but we guesstimated it was equivalent to a low-grade nuclear exchange between the United States and former Soviet Union, and that’s not including the actual nuclear exchange between Iran and Pakistan.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[194]:945,1039
We watched and recorded those as well, the flashes and fires that gave me eye spots for days.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[194]:1039,1129
Nuclear autumn was already beginning to set in, the gray-brown shroud thickening each day.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[195]:0,96
It was like looking down on an alien planet, or on Earth during the last great mass extinction.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[195]:96,204
Eventually conventional optics became useless in the shroud, leaving us with only thermal or radar sensors.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[195]:204,275
Earth’s natural face vanished behind a caricature of primary colors.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[195]:275,399
It was through one of these systems, the Aster sensor aboard the Terra Satellite, that we saw the Three Gorges Dam collapse.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[196]:0,132
Roughly ten trillion gallons of water, carrying debris, silt, rocks, trees, cars, houses, and house-sized pieces of the dam itself!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[196]:132,201
It was alive, a brown and white dragon racing to the East China Sea.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[196]:201,359
When I think of the people in its path…trapped in barricaded buildings, unable to escape the tidal wave because of the Zed Heads right outside their doors.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[196]:359,405
No one knows how many people died that night.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[196]:405,448
Even today, they’re still finding bodies.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[197]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[198]
[One of his skeletal hands balls into a fist, the other presses the “self-medicate” button.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[199]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[200]:0,146
When I think about how the Chinese leadership tried to explain it all away…Have you ever read a transcript of the Chinese president’s speech?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[200]:146,224
We actually watched the broadcast from a pirated signal off their Sinosat II.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[200]:224,274
He called it an “unforeseen tragedy.” Really?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[200]:274,286
Unforeseen?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[200]:286,357
Was it unforeseen that the dam had been built on an active fault line?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[200]:357,556
Was it unforeseen that the increased weight of a giant reservoir had induced earthquakes in the past 9 and that cracks had already been detected in the foundation months before the dam was completed?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[201]:0,53
He called it an “unavoidable accident.” Bastard.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[201]:53,228
They had enough troops to wage open warfare in almost every major city, but they couldn’t spare a couple of traffic cops to protect against a catastrophe waiting to happen?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[201]:228,352
No one could imagine the repercussions of abandoning both the seismic warning stations and the emergency spillway controls?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[201]:352,581
And then to try to change their story halfway through, to say that they’d actually done everything they could to protect the dam, that, at the time of the disaster, valiant troops of the PLA had given their lives to defend it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[201]:581,757
Well, I’d been personally observing Three Gorges for over a year leading up to the disaster and the only PLA soldiers I ever saw had given their lives a long, long time ago.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[201]:757,824
Did they really expect their own people to buy such a blatant lie?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[201]:824,884
Did they really expect anything less than all-out rebellion?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[202]:0,127
Two weeks after the start of the revolution, we received our first and only signal from the Chinese space station, Yang Liwei.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[202]:127,240
It was the only other manned facility in orbit, but couldn’t compare to such an exquisite masterpiece as ours.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[202]:240,379
It was more of a slapdash job, Shenzhou modules and Long March fuel tanks cobbled together like a giant version of the old American Skylab.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[203]:0,47
We’d been trying to contact them for months.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[203]:47,91
We weren’t even sure if there was a crew.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[203]:91,246
All we got was a recorded message in perfect Hong Kong English to keep our distance lest we invite a response of “deadly force.” What an insane waste!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[203]:246,315
We could have worked together, traded supplies, technical expertise.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[203]:315,434
Who knows what we could have accomplished if we had only chucked the politics and come together as human bloody beings.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[204]:0,126
We’d convinced ourselves that the station had never been inhabited at all, that their deadly force warning was just a ruse.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[204]:126,206
We couldn’t have been more surprised when the signal came over our ham radio.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[204]:206,297
10 It was a live human voice, tired, frightened, and cutting out after only a few seconds.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[204]:297,362
It was all I needed to board the Verne and head over to the Yang.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[205]:0,87
As soon as it came over the horizon I could tell that its orbit had shifted radically.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[205]:87,130
As I closed the distance, I could see why.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[205]:130,273
Their escape pod had blown its hatch, and because it was still docked to the primary airlock, the entire station had depressurized in seconds.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[205]:273,321
As a precaution, I requested docking clearance.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[205]:321,336
I got nothing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[205]:336,504
As I came aboard, I could see that even though the station was clearly large enough for a crew of seven or eight, it only had the bunk space and personal kits for two.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[205]:504,613
I found the Yang packed with emergency supplies, enough food, water, and O2 candles for at least five years.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[205]:613,660
What I couldn’t figure out at first was why.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[205]:660,736
There was no scientific equipment aboard, no intelligence-gathering assets.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[205]:736,848
It was almost like the Chinese government had sent these two men into space for no other purpose than to exist.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[205]:848,932
Fifteen minutes into my floatabout, I found the first of several scuttling charges.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[205]:932,1004
This space station was little more than a giant Orbital Denial Vehicle.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[205]:1004,1227
If those charges were to detonate, the debris from a four-hundred-metric-ton space station would not only be enough to damage or destroy any other orbiting platform, but any future space launch would be grounded for years.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[205]:1227,1318
It was a “Scorched Space” policy, “if we can’t have it, neither can anyone else.”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[206]:0,52
All the station’s systems were still operational.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[206]:52,171
There had been no fire, no structural damage, no reason I could see to cause the accident of the escape pod’s hatch.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[206]:171,259
I found the body of a lone taikonaut with his hand still clinging to the hatch release.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[206]:259,363
He was wearing one of their pressurized escape suits, but the faceplate had been shattered by a bullet.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[206]:363,416
I’m guessing the shooter was blown out into space.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[206]:416,587
I’d like to believe that the Chinese revolution wasn’t just restricted to Earth, that the man who’d blown the hatch was also the one who had attempted to signal us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[206]:587,630
His mate must have stuck by the old guard.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[206]:630,703
Maybe Mister Loyalist had been ordered to set off the scuttling charges.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[206]:703,837
Zhai—that was the name on his personal effects—Zhai had tried to blast his mate into space and had caught a round in the process.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[206]:837,869
Makes for a good tale, I think.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[206]:869,909
That’s how I’m going to remember it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[207]:0,52
Is that how you were able to extend your endurance?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[207]:52,90
By using the supplies aboard the Yang?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[208]:0,86
[He gives me a thumbs-up.] We cannibalized every inch of it for spares and materials.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[208]:86,216
We would have liked to have merged the two platforms together but we didn’t have the tools or manpower for such an undertaking.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[208]:216,277
We might been able to use the escape pod to return to Earth.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[208]:277,318
It had a heat shield and room for three.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[208]:318,340
It was very tempting.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[208]:340,469
But the station’s orbit was decaying rapidly, and we had to make a choice then and there, escape to Earth or resupply the ISS.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[208]:469,499
You know which choice we made.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[209]:0,66
Before we finally abandoned her, we laid our friend Zhai to rest.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[209]:66,229
We strapped his body into its bunk, brought his personal kit back to the ISS, and said a few words in his honor as the Yang burned up in the Earth’s atmosphere.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[209]:229,347
For all we knew he might have been the loyalist, not the rebel, but either way, his actions allowed us to stay alive.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[209]:347,470
Three more years we remained in orbit, three more years that wouldn’t have been possible without the Chinese consumables.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[210]:0,137
I still think it’s one of the war’s great ironies that our replacement crew ended up arriving in a privately owned civilian vehicle.

====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[211]:67,97
I can’t speak for my mates.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[211]:97,162
On their deathbeds they both said they’d do it all over again.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[211]:162,182
How can I disagree?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[211]:182,333
I don’t regret the physical therapy that followed, getting to know my bones again and remembering why the good Lord gave us legs in the first place.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[211]:333,473
I don’t regret being exposed to so much cosmic radiation, all those unprotected EVAs, all that time with inadequate shielding in the ISS.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[211]:473,496
I don’t regret this.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[211]:496,645
[He motions to the hospital room and machinery attached to his body.] We made our choice, and, I’d like to think, we made a difference in the end.

The history books call it “The Honolulu Conference,” but really it should have been called the “Saratoga Conference” because that’s all any of us had a chance to see.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[217]:177,259
We spent fourteen days in those cramped compartments and dank stuffy passageways.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[217]:259,378
USS Saratoga: from aircraft carrier, to decommissioned hulk, to evacuee transport barge, to floating United Nations HQ.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[218]:0,51
It also shouldn’t have been called a conference.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[218]:51,92
If anything, it was more like an ambush.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[218]:92,162
We were supposed to be exchanging warfighting tactics and technology.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[218]:162,306
Everyone was anxious to see the British method of fortified motorways, which was almost as exciting as that live demonstration of Mkunga Lalem.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[218]:306,399
1 We were also supposed to be attempting to reintroduce some measure of international trade.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[218]:399,514
That was my task, specifically, to integrate the remnants of our navy into the new international convoy structure.
====

I wasn’t really sure what to expect from my time aboard Super Sara.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[218]:584,650
I don’t think anyone could have expected what actually happened.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[219]:0,76
On the first day of the conference, we’d assembled for the introductions.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[219]:76,171
I was hot and tired and wishing to God we could just get on without all the tiresome speeches.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[219]:171,256
And then the American ambassador rose, and the whole world came to a screeching halt.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[220]:0,133
It was time to go on the attack, he said, to all get out from behind our established defenses and begin retaking infested territory.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[220]:133,280
At first I thought he simply meant isolated operations: securing more inhabitable islands or, perhaps, even reopening the Suez/Panama canal zones.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[220]:280,320
My supposition didn’t last very long.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[220]:320,411
He made it very clear that this was not going to be a series of minor tactical incursions.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[220]:411,705
The United States intended to go permanently on the offensive, marching forward every day, until, as he put it, “every trace was sponged, and purged, and, if need be, blasted from the surface of the Earth.” Maybe he thought ripping off Churchill would give it some kind of emotional punch.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[220]:705,718
It didn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[220]:718,774
Instead, the room spontaneously combusted into argument.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[221]:0,191
One side asked why in hell should we risk even more lives, suffer even one more unnecessary casualties when all we had to do was remain safe and sedentary while our enemy simply rotted away.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[221]:191,222
Wasn’t it happening already?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[221]:222,301
Weren’t the earliest cases starting to show signs of advanced decomposition?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[221]:301,335
Time was on our side, not theirs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[221]:335,377
Why not let nature do all the work for us?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[222]:0,73
The other side countered that not all the living dead were rotting away.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[222]:73,136
What about the later cases, the ones still strong and healthy?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[222]:136,191
Couldn’t just one restart the plague all over again?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[222]:191,254
And what about those who prowled countries above the snowline?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[222]:254,295
How long would we have to wait for them?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[222]:295,304
Decades?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[222]:304,315
Centuries?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[222]:315,388
Would refugees from these countries ever have a chance of returning home?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[223]:0,31
And that’s when it got ugly.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[223]:31,560
Many of the colder countries were what you used to call “First World.” One of the delegates from a prewar “developing” country suggested, rather hotly, that maybe this was their punishment for raping and pillaging the “victim nations of the south.” Maybe, he said, by keeping the “white hegemony” distracted with their own problems, the undead invasion might allow the rest of the world to develop “without imperialist intervention.” Maybe the living dead had brought more than just devastation to the world.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[223]:560,619
Maybe in the end, they had brought justice for the future.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[223]:619,836
Now, my people have little love for the northern gringos, and my family suffered enough under Pinochet to make that animosity personal, but there comes a point where private emotions must give way to objective facts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[223]:836,996
How could there be a “white hegemony” when the most dynamic prewar economies were China and India, and the largest wartime economy was unquestionably Cuba?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[223]:996,1148
How could you call the colder countries a northern issue when so many people were just barely surviving in the Himalayas, or the Andes of my own Chile?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[223]:1148,1241
No, this man, and those who agreed with him, weren’t talking about justice for the future.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[223]:1241,1279
They just wanted revenge for the past.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[224]
[Sighs.] After all we’d been through, we still couldn’t take our heads from out of our asses or our hands from around each other’s throats.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[225]:0,133
I was standing next to the Russian delegate, trying to prevent her from climbing over her seat, when I heard another American voice.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[225]:133,157
It was their president.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[225]:157,212
The man didn’t shout, didn’t try to restore order.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[225]:212,327
He just kept going in that calm, firm tone that I don’t think any world leader has since been able to duplicate.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[225]:327,655
He even thanked his “fellow delegates” for their “valued opinions” and admitted that, from a purely military perspective, there was no reason to “push our luck.” We’d fought the living dead to a stalemate and, eventually, future generations might be able to reinhabit the planet with little or no physical danger.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[225]:655,743
Yes, our defensive strategies had saved the human race, but what about the human spirit?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[226]:0,65
The living dead had taken more from us than land and loved ones.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[226]:65,140
They’d robbed us of our confidence as the planet’s dominant life-form.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[226]:140,289
We were a shaken, broken species, driven to the edge of extinction and grateful only for a tomorrow with perhaps a little less suffering than today.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[226]:289,441
Was this the legacy we would leave to our children, a level of anxiety and self-doubt not seen since our simian ancestors cowered in the tallest trees?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[226]:441,480
What kind of world would they rebuild?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[226]:480,507
Would they rebuild at all?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[226]:507,602
Could they continue to progress, knowing that they had been powerless to reclaim their future?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[226]:602,663
And what if that future saw another rise of the living dead?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[226]:663,814
Would our descendants rise to meet them in battle, or simply crumple in meek surrender and accept what they believe to be their inevitable extinction?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[226]:814,867
For this reason alone, we had to reclaim our planet.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[226]:867,973
We had to prove to ourselves that we could do it, and leave that proof as this war’s greatest monument.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[226]:973,1069
The long, hard road back to humanity, or the regressive ennui of Earth’s once-proud primates.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[226]:1069,1116
That was the choice, and it had to be made now.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[227]:0,93
So typically Norteamericano, reaching for the stars with their asses still stuck in the mud.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[227]:93,316
I guess, if this was a gringo movie, you’d see some idiot get up and start clapping slowly, then the others would join in and then we’d see a tear roll down someone’s cheek or some other contrived bullshit like that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[227]:316,337
Everyone was silent.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[227]:337,351
No one moved.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[227]:351,482
The president announced that we would recess for the afternoon to consider his proposal, then reconvene at dusk for a general vote.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[228]:0,67
As naval attaché, I wasn’t allowed to participate in that vote.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[228]:67,177
While the ambassador decided the fate of our beloved Chile, I had nothing to do but enjoy the Pacific sunset.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[228]:177,320
I sat on the flight deck, wedged in between the windmills and solar cells, killing time with my opposite numbers from France and South Africa.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[228]:320,417
We tried not to talk shop, searching for any common subject as far from the war as we could get.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[228]:417,452
We thought we were safe with wine.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[228]:452,599
As luck might have it, each of us had either lived near, worked on, or had family connected with a vineyard: Aconcagua, Stellenboch, and Bordeaux.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[228]:599,690
Those were our bonding points and, as with everything else, they led right back to the war.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:0,110
Aconcagua had been destroyed, burned to the ground during our country’s disastrous experiments with napalm.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:110,157
Stellenboch was now growing subsistence crops.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:157,234
Grapes were considered a luxury when the population was close to starvation.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:234,332
Bordeaux was overrun, the dead crushing its soil underfoot like almost all of continental France.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:332,380
Commander Emile Renard was morbidly optimistic.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:380,459
Who knows, he said, what the nutrients of their corpses would do for the soil?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:459,554
Maybe it would even improve on the overall taste once Bordeaux was retaken, if it was retaken.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:554,653
As the sun began to dip, Renard took something from his kit bag, a bottle of Chateau Latour, 1964.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:653,685
We couldn’t believe our eyes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:685,733
The ’64 was an extremely rare prewar vintage.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:733,896
By sheer chance, the vineyard had had a bumper crop that season and had chosen to harvest its grapes in late August as opposed to the traditional early September.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:896,1044
That September was marked by early, devastating rains, which inundated the other vineyards and elevated Chateau Latour to almost Holy Grail status.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:1044,1161
The bottle in Renard’s hand might be the last of its kind, the perfect symbol of a world we might never see again.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:1161,1237
It was the only personal item he’d managed to save during the evacuation.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:1237,1393
He carried it with him everywhere, and was planning to save it for…ever, possibly, seeing as it looked like none of any vintage would ever be made again.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[229]:1393,1442
But now, after the Yankee president’s speech…

It hadn’t traveled that well, and the plastic mugs didn’t help.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[233]:68,86
We didn’t care.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[233]:86,107
We savored every sip.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[234]
You were pretty confident about the vote?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[235]:0,54
Not that it would be unanimous, and I was damn right.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[235]:54,216
Seventeen “No” votes and thirty-one “Abstain.” At least the no voters were willing to suffer the long-term consequences of their decision…and they did.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[235]:216,328
When you think that the new UN only consisted of seventy-two delegates, the showing of support was pretty poor.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[235]:328,468
Not that it mattered for me or my other two amateur “sommeliers.” For us, our countries, our children, the choice had been made: attack.

[Shakes his head.] I don’t know who created the stereotype of the hard-charging, dim-witted, high school football coach of a general officer.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[247]:144,311
Maybe it was Hollywood, or the civilian press, or maybe we did it to ourselves by allowing those insipid, egocentric clowns—the MacArthurs and Halseys and Curtis E.

LeMays—to define our image to the rest of the country.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[247]:368,463
Point is, that’s the image of those in uniform, and it couldn’t be further from the truth.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[247]:463,595
I was scared to death of taking our armed forces on the offensive, more so because it wouldn’t be my ass hanging out in the fire.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[247]:595,687
I’d only be sending others out to die, and here’s what I’d be sending them up against.

Two hundred million zombies 1 .
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[251]:32,97
Who can even visualize that type of number, let alone combat it?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[251]:97,394
At least this time around we knew what we were combating, but when you added up all the experience, all the data we’d compiled on their origin, their physiology, their strengths, their weaknesses, their motives, and their mentality, it still presented us with a very gloomy prospect for victory.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[252]:0,119
The book of war, the one we’ve been writing since one ape slapped another, was completely useless in this situation.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[252]:119,158
We had to write a new one from scratch.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[253]:0,132
All armies, be they mechanized or mountain guerilla, have to abide by three basic restrictions: they have to be bred, fed, and led.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[253]:132,475
Bred: you need warm bodies, or else you don’t have an army; fed: once you’ve got that army, they’ve got to be supplied; and led: no matter how decentralized that fighting force is, there has to be someone among them with the authority to say “follow me.” Bred, fed, and led; and none of these restrictions applied to the living dead.
====

Did you ever read All Quiet on the Western Front?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[254]:50,197
Remarque paints a vivid picture of Germany becoming “empty,” meaning that toward the end of the war, they were simply running out of soldiers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[254]:197,383
You can fudge the numbers, send the old men and little boys, but eventually you’re going to hit the ceiling…unless every time you killed an enemy, he came back to life on your side.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[254]:383,448
That’s how Zack operated, swelling his ranks by thinning ours!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[254]:448,476
And it only worked one way.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[254]:476,513
Infect a human, he becomes a zombie.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[254]:513,549
Kill a zombie, he becomes a corpse.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[254]:549,614
We could only get weaker, while they might actually get stronger.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[255]:0,52
All human armies need supplies, this army didn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[255]:52,122
No food, no ammo, no fuel, not even water to drink or air to breathe!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[255]:122,184
There were no logistics lines to sever, no depots to destroy.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[255]:184,361
You couldn’t just surround and starve them out, or let them “wither on the vine.” Lock a hundred of them in a room and three years later they’ll come out just as deadly.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[256]:0,138
It’s ironic that the only way to kill a zombie is to destroy its brain, because, as a group, they have no collective brain to speak of.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[256]:138,230
There was no leadership, no chain of command, no communication or cooperation on any level.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[256]:230,304
There was no president to assassinate, no HQ bunker to surgically strike.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[256]:304,431
Each zombie is its own, self-contained, automated unit, and this last advantage is what truly encapsulates the entire conflict.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:0,94
You’ve heard the expression “total war”; it’s pretty common throughout human history.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:94,328
Every generation or so, some gasbag likes to spout about how his people have declared “total war” against an enemy, meaning that every man, woman, and child within his nation was committing every second of their lives to victory.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:328,366
That is bullshit on two basic levels.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:366,475
First of all, no country or group is ever 100 percent committed to war; it’s just not physically possible.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:475,591
You can have a high percentage, so many people working so hard for so long, but all of the people, all of the time?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:591,651
What about the malingerers, or the conscientious objectors?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:651,715
What about the sick, the injured, the very old, the very young?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:715,793
What about when you’re sleeping, eating, taking a shower, or taking a dump?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:793,827
Is that a “dump for victory”?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:827,889
That’s the first reason total war is impossible for humans.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:889,939
The second is that all nations have their limits.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:939,1197
There might be individuals within that group who are willing to sacrifice their lives; it might even be a relatively high number for the population, but that population as a whole will eventually reach its maximum emotional and physiological breaking point.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:1197,1265
The Japanese reached theirs with a couple of American atomic bombs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:1265,1408
The Vietnamese might have reached theirs if we’d dropped a couple more, 2 but, thank all holy Christ, our will broke before it came to that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[257]:1408,1626
That is the nature of human warfare, two sides trying to push the other past its limit of endurance, and no matter how much we like to talk about total war, that limit is always there…unless you’re the living dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[258]:0,85
For the first time in history, we faced an enemy that was actively waging total war.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[258]:85,118
They had no limits of endurance.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[258]:118,163
They would never negotiate, never surrender.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[258]:163,316
They would fight until the very end because, unlike us, every single one of them, every second of every day, was devoted to consuming all life on Earth.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[258]:316,387
That’s the kind of enemy that was waiting for us beyond the Rockies.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[258]:387,428
That’s the kind of war we had to fight.

It was kinda like stepping back in time, the new army, I mean.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[262]:63,167
It couldn’t have been any more different from the one I’d fought, and almost died with, at Yonkers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[262]:167,267
We weren’t mechanized anymore—no tanks, no arty, no tread jobs 1 at all, not even the Bradleys.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[262]:267,357
Those were still in reserve, being modified for when we’d have to take back the cities.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[262]:357,473
No, the only wheeled vehicles we had, the Humvees and a few M-trip-Seven ASVs, 2 were used to carry ammo and stuff.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[262]:473,556
We hoofed it, all the way, marching in column like you see in Civil War paintings.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[262]:556,696
There was a lot of references to “the Blue” versus “the Gray,” mainly because of Zack’s skin color and the shade of our new BDUs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[262]:696,777
They didn’t bother with camo schemes anymore; in any case, what was the point?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[262]:777,842
And, I guess, navy blue was the cheapest dye they had back then.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[262]:842,900
The BDU itself looked more like a SWAT team’s coverall.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[262]:900,1002
It was light and comfortable and interwoven with Kevlar, I think it was Kevlar, 3 bite-proof threads.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[262]:1002,1075
It had the option of gloves and a hood that would cover your whole face.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[262]:1075,1138
Later, in urban hand-to-hand, that option saved a lot of lives.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[263]:0,46
Everything had kind of a retro feel about it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[263]:46,121
Our Lobos looked like something out of, I don’t know, Lord of the Rings?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[263]:121,216
Standard orders were to use it only when necessary, but, trust me, we made it necessary a lot.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[263]:216,284
It just felt good, you know, swingin’ that solid hunk a’ steel.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[263]:284,317
It made it personal, empowering.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[263]:317,349
You could feel the skull split.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[263]:349,409
A real rush, like you were taking back your life, you know?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[263]:409,447
Not that I minded pulling the trigger.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:0,57
Our primary weapon was the SIR, standard infantry rifle.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:57,173
The wood furniture made it look like a World War II gun; I guess composite materials were too hard to mass-produce.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:173,224
I’m not sure where the SIR supposedly came from.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:224,264
I’ve heard it was a modcop of the AK.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:264,399
I’ve also heard that it was a stripped-down version of the XM 8, which the army was already planning as its next-gen assault weapon.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:399,545
I’ve even heard that it was invented, tested, and first produced during the siege of the Hero City, and the plans were transmitted to Honolulu.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:545,594
Honestly, I don’t know, and I so don’t care.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:594,701
It might have kicked hard, and it only fired on semi, but it was super accurate and it never, ever jammed!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:701,820
You could drag it through the mud, leave it in the sand, you could drop it in saltwater and let it sit there for days.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:820,890
No matter what you did to this baby, it just wouldn’t let you down.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:890,1018
The only bells and whistles it had was a conversion kit of extra parts, furniture, and additional barrels of different lengths.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:1018,1158
You could go long-range sniper, midrange rifle, or close-combat carbine, all in the same hour, and without reaching farther than your ruck.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:1158,1289
It also had a spike, this little flip-out job, about eight inches long, that you could use in a pinch if your Lobo wasn’t handy.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:1289,1389
We used to joke “careful, you’ll poke somebody’s eye out,” which, of course, we did plenty.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[264]:1389,1593
The SIR made a pretty good close combat weapon, even without the spike, and when you add all the other things that made it so awesome, you can see why we always referred to it, respectfully, as “Sir.”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[265]:0,104
Our staple ammo was the NATO 5.56 “Cherry PIE.” PIE stands for pyrotechnically initiated explosive.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[265]:104,124
Outstanding design.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[265]:124,205
It would shatter on entry into Zack’s skull and fragments would fry its brain.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[265]:205,283
No risk of spreading infected gray matter, and no need for wasteful bonfires.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[265]:283,353
On BS 4 duty, you didn’t even have to decap before you buried them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[265]:353,400
Just dig the trench and roll the whole body in.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[266]:0,62
Yeah, it was a new army, as much the people as anything else.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[266]:62,141
Recruitment had changed, and being a grunt meant something very different now.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[266]:141,371
You still had the old requirements—physical stamina, mental competence, the motivation and discipline to master difficult challenges in extreme conditions—but all that was mouse farts if you couldn’t hack long-term Z-shock.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[266]:371,430
I saw a lot of good friends just lose it under the strain.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[266]:430,518
Some of them collapsed, some turned their weapons on themselves, some on their buddies.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[266]:518,590
It didn’t have anything to do with being brave or anything like that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[266]:590,844
I once read this British SAS survival guide that talked all about the “warrior” personality, how your family’s supposed to be emotionally and financially stable, and how you’re not even supposed to be attracted to girls when you’re real young.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[266]:844,916
[Grunts.] Survival guides…[Jerks his hand in a masturbatory movement.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[267]:0,147
But the new faces, they could have been from anywhere: your neighbor, your aunt, that geeky substitute teacher, or that fat, lazy slob at the DMV.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[267]:147,264
From former insurance salesmen to a guy who I’m damn sure was Michael Stipe, although I never got him to admit it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[267]:264,371
I guess it all made sense; anyone who couldn’t roll wouldn’t have made it this far in the first place.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[267]:371,417
Everyone was already a veteran in some sense.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[267]:417,510
My battle buddy, Sister Montoya, fifty-two years old, she’d been a nun, still was I guess.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[267]:510,646
Five three and a buck even, she’d protected her whole Sunday school class for nine days with nothing but a six-foot iron candlestick.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[267]:646,830
I don’t know how she managed to hump that ruck, but she did, without complaining, from our assembly area in Needles, all the way to our contact site just outside of Hope, New Mexico.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[268]:0,6
Hope.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[268]:6,58
I’m not kidding, the town was actually named Hope.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[269]:0,119
They say the brass chose it because of the terrain, clear and open with the desert in front and the mountains in back.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[269]:119,211
Perfect, they said, for an opening engagement, and that the name had nothing to do with it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[269]:211,217
Right.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[270]:0,53
The brass really wanted this test-op to go smoothly.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[270]:53,126
It’d be the first major ground engagement we’d fought since Yonkers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[270]:126,211
It was that moment, you know, like, when a lot of different things all come together.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[271]
Watershed?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[272]:0,15
Yeah, I think.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[272]:15,162
All the new people, the new stuff, the new training, the new plan—everything was supposed to sort of mix together for this one first big kickoff.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[273]:0,47
We’d encountered a couple dozen Gs en route.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[273]:47,129
Sniffer dogs would find them, and handlers with silenced weapons would drop them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[273]:129,184
We didn’t want to attract too many till we were set.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[273]:184,218
We wanted this to be on our terms.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[274]:0,104
We started planting our “garden”: shelter stakes with orange Day-Glo tape in rows every ten meters.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[274]:104,178
They were our range markers, showing us exactly where to zero our sights.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[274]:178,277
For some of us there was also some light duty like clearing the brush or arranging the ammo crates.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[275]:0,161
For the rest of us, there was nothing to do except wait, just grab some chow, recharge our camel packs, or even snag some bag time, if it was possible to sleep.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[275]:161,197
We’d learned a lot since Yonkers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[275]:197,225
The brass wanted us rested.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[275]:225,280
The problem was, it gave us all too much time to think.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[276]:0,53
Did you see the movie, the one Elliot made about us?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[276]:53,213
That scene with the campfire and the grunts all jawing in this witty dialogue, the stories and the dreams for the future, and even that guy with the harmonica.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[276]:213,244
Dude, it was so not like that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[276]:244,368
First of all, it was the middle of the day, no campfires, no harmonica under the stars, and also everyone was really quiet.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[276]:368,531
You knew what everyone was thinking though, “What the hell are we doing here?” This was Zack’s house now, and as far as we were concerned, he could have it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[276]:531,728
We’d all had plenty of pep talks about “The Future of the Human Spirit.” We’d seen the president’s speech God knows how many times, but the prez wasn’t out here on Zack’s front lawn.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[276]:728,774
We had a good thing going behind the Rockies.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[276]:774,811
What the hell were we doing out here?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[277]:0,100
Around 1300 hours, the radios started squawking, it was the K-handlers whose dogs had made contact.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[277]:100,159
We locked and loaded and took our place on the firing line.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[278]:0,100
That was the centerpiece of our whole new battle doctrine, back into the past like everything else.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[278]:100,166
We massed in a straight line, two ranks: one active, one reserve.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[278]:166,286
The reserve was so when anyone in the front rank needed a weapon recharge, their fire wouldn’t be missed on the line.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[278]:286,399
Theoretically, with everyone either firing or reloading, we could keep Zack falling as long as the ammo held out.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[279]:0,57
We could hear the barking, the Ks were bringing them in.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[279]:57,104
We started seeing Gs on the horizon, hundreds.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[279]:104,199
I started shaking even though it wasn’t the first time I’d had to face Zack since Yonkers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[279]:199,251
I’d been in the clean and sweep operations in LA.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[279]:251,320
I’d done my time in the Rockies when the summer thawed the passes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[279]:320,349
Each time I got major shakes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[280]:0,49
The dogs were recalled, racing behind our lines.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[280]:49,103
We switched over to our Primary Enticement Mechanism.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[280]:103,130
Every army had one by now.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[280]:130,288
The Brits would use bagpipes, the Chinese used bugles, the Sou’fricans used to smack their rifles with their assegais 5 and belt out these Zulu war chants.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[280]:288,326
For us, it was hard-core Iron Maiden.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[280]:326,374
Now, personally, I’ve never been a metal fan.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[280]:374,474
Straight classic rock’s my thing, and Hendrix’s “Driving South” is about as heavy as I get.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[280]:474,585
But I had to admit, standing there in that desert wind, with “The Trooper” thumping in my chest, I got it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[280]:585,631
The PEM wasn’t really for Zack’s benefit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[280]:631,740
It was to psych us up, take away some of Zack’s mojo, you know, “take the piss out,” as the Brits say.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[280]:740,904
Right about the time Dickinson was belting “As you plunge into a certain death” I was pumped, SIR charged and ready, eyes fixed on this growing, closing horde.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[280]:904,964
I was, like, “C’mon, Zack, let’s fuckin’ do this!”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[281]:0,74
Just before they reached the front range marker, the music began to fade.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[281]:74,152
The squad leaders shouted, “Front rank, ready!” and the first line knelt.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[281]:152,274
Then came the order to “take aim!” and then, as we all held our breath, as the music clicked off, we heard “FIRE!”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[282]:0,115
The front rank just rippled, cracking like a SAW on full auto and dropping every G that crossed the first markers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[282]:115,170
We had strict orders, only the ones crossing the line.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[282]:170,191
Wait for the others.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[282]:191,227
We’d trained this way for months.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[282]:227,256
By now it was pure instinct.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[282]:256,334
Sister Montoya raised her weapon above her head, the signal for an empty mag.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[282]:334,411
We switched positions, I flipped off my safety, and sighted my first target.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[282]:411,479
She was a noob, 6 couldn’t have been dead more than a year or so.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[282]:479,547
Her dirty blond hair hung in patches from her tight, leathery skin.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[282]:547,630
Her swollen belly puffed through a faded black T-shirt that read G IS FOR GANGSTA.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[282]:630,868
I centered my sight between her shrunken, milky blue eyes…you know it’s not really the eyes that make them look all cloudy, it’s actually tiny dust scratches on the surface, thousands of them, because Zack doesn’t make any tears.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[282]:868,950
Those scratched-up baby blues were looking right at me when I pulled the trigger.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[282]:950,1029
The round knocked her on her back, steam coming from the hole in her forehead.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[282]:1029,1105
I took a breath, sighted my next target, and that was that, I was locked in.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[283]:0,47
Doctrine calls for one shot every full second.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[283]:47,77
Slow, steady, mechanical-like.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[284]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[285]
[He begins snapping his fingers.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[286]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[287]:0,171
On the range we practiced with metronomes, all the time the instructors saying “they ain’t in no hurry, why are you?” It was a way of keeping calm, pacing yourself.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[287]:171,213
We had to be as slow and robotic as them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[287]:213,249
“Out G the G,” they used to say.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[288]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[289]
[His fingers snap in perfect rhythm.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[290]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[291]
Shooting, switching, reloading, grabbing sips from your camel pack, grabbing clips from the “Sandlers.”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[292]
Sandlers?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[293]:0,101
Yeah, the Recharge Teams, this special reserve unit that did nothing but make sure we never ran dry.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[293]:101,213
You only had a certain number of clips on you and it would take a lot more time to reload each individual clip.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[293]:213,359
The Sandlers ran up and down the line collecting empty clips, recharging them from crated ammo, and then passing them out to anyone who signaled.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[293]:359,603
The story is that when the army started training with RTs, one of the guys started doin’ an Adam Sandler impression, you know, “Water Boy”—“Ammo Boy.” The officers weren’t too jazzed with the tag, but the Recharge Teams loved it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[293]:603,662
Sandlers were lifesavers, drilled like a fuckin’ ballet.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[293]:662,741
I don’t think anyone that day or night ever found themselves one round short.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[294]
That night?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[295]
They just kept coming, full on Chain Swarm.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[296]
That’s a large-scale attack?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[297]:0,16
More than that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[297]:16,60
One G sees you, comes after you, and moans.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[297]:60,187
A click away, another G hears that moan, comes after it, and moans himself, then another one another click away, then another.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[297]:187,295
Dude, if the area’s thick enough, if the chain’s unbroken, who knows how far you can pull them in from.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[297]:295,346
And we’re just talking one after the other here.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[297]:346,389
Try ten every click, a hundred, a thousand.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[298]:0,146
They started piling up, forming this artificial palisade at the first range marker, this ridge of corpses that got higher and higher each minute.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[298]:146,286
We were actually building an undead fortification, creating a situation where all we had to do was pop every head that popped over the top.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[298]:286,318
The brass had planned for this.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[298]:318,397
They had a periscope tower thingy 7 that let officers see right over the wall.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[298]:397,525
They also had real-time downlinks from satellites and recon drones, although we, the grunts, had no idea what they were seeing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[298]:525,625
Land Warrior was gone for now so all we had to do was concentrate on what was in front of our faces.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[299]:0,128
We started getting contacts from all sides, either coming around the wall or else being drawn in from our flanks and even rear.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[299]:128,195
Again, the brass was waiting for this and ordered us to form an RS.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[300]
A Reinforced Square.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[301]:0,63
Or a “Raj-Singh,” I guess after the guy who reinvented it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[301]:63,151
We formed a tight square, still two ranks, with our vehicles and whatnot in the center.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[301]:151,206
That was a dangerous gamble, cutting us off like that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[301]:206,294
I mean, yeah, it didn’t work that first time in India only ’cause the ammo ran out.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[301]:294,355
But there was no guarantee it wouldn’t happen again to us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[301]:355,468
What if the brass had goofed, hadn’t packed enough rounds or underestimated how strong Zack would be that day?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[301]:468,569
It could have been Yonkers all over again; worse, because no one would be getting out of there alive.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[302]
But you did have enough ammunition.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[303]:0,18
More than enough.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[303]:18,59
The vehicles were packed to their roofs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[303]:59,94
We had water, we had replacements.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[303]:94,222
If you needed a fiver, you just raised your weapon and one of the Sandlers would jump in and take our place on the firing line.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[303]:222,301
You’d grab a bite of I-Rations, 8 soak your face, stretch, drain the weasel.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[303]:301,433
No one would ever volunteer for a fiver, but they had these KO 9 teams, combat shrinks who were observing everyone’s performance.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[303]:433,618
They’d been with us since our early days on the range, knew us each by name and face, and knew, don’t ask me how, when the stress of battle was starting to degrade our performance.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[303]:618,658
We didn’t know, I certainly didn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[303]:658,749
There were a couple times I’d miss a shot or maybe take a half second instead of a full.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[303]:749,834
Then suddenly I’d get this tap on my shoulder and I knew I was out of it for five.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[303]:834,852
It really worked.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[303]:852,960
Before I knew it, I was back on the line, bladder empty, stomach quiet, a few less kinks and muscle cramps.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[303]:960,1117
It made a world of difference, and anyone who thinks we could have lasted without it should try hitting a moving bull’s-eye every second for fifteen hours.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[304]
What about at night?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[305]:0,111
We used searchlights from the vehicles, powerful, red-coated beams so it didn’t mess with your night vision.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[305]:111,246
The only creepy thing about night fighting, other than the redness from the lights, is the glow a round makes when it enters the head.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[305]:246,403
That’s why we called them “Cherry PIES,” because if the bullet’s chemcomp wasn’t mixed right, it would burn so bright it made their eyes glow red.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[305]:403,539
That was a cure for constipation, especially later on, on nights when you pulled guard duty, and one would come at you out of the dark.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[305]:539,606
Those glowing red eyes, frozen in time the second before it falls.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[305]:606,616
[Shivers.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[306]
How did you know the battle was over?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[307]:0,26
When we stopped shooting?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[307]:26,75
[Laughs.] No, that’s actually a good question.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[307]:75,130
Around, I don’t know, 0400, it started to taper off.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[307]:130,166
Heads weren’t poking out as much.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[307]:166,191
The moan was dying down.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[307]:191,332
The officers didn’t tell us that the attack was almost over, but you could see them looking through their scopes, talking on their radios.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[307]:332,373
You could see the relief in their faces.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[307]:373,423
I think the last shot was fired just before dawn.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[307]:423,466
After that, we just waited for first light.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[308]:0,74
It was kinda eerie, the sun rising over this mountainous ring of corpses.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[308]:74,178
We were totally walled in, all sides were piled at least twenty feet high and over a hundred feet deep.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[308]:178,273
I’m not sure how many we killed that day, stats always vary depending on who you get it from.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[309]:0,91
The dozer-blade Humvees had to push a path through the corpse ring just to let us get out.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[309]:91,257
There were still living Gs, some slow ones who were late to the party or who had tried to climb up and over their dead friends and had slid back down into the mound.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[309]:257,316
When we started burying the bodies they came tumbling out.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[309]:316,366
That was the only time Señor Lobo saw any action.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[310]:0,55
At least we didn’t have to stick around for BS duty.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[310]:55,109
They had another unit waiting in reserve to clean up.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[310]:109,167
I guess the brass figured we’d done enough for one day.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[310]:167,262
We marched ten miles to the east, set up a bivouac with watchtowers and concertainer 10 walls.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[310]:262,282
I was so damn beat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[310]:282,426
I don’t remember the chem shower, turning in my gear to be disinfected, turning in my weapon for inspection: not one jam, not the whole unit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[310]:426,471
I don’t even remember slipping into my bag.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[311]:0,53
They let us sleep as late as we wanted the next day.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[311]:53,76
That was pretty sweet.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[311]:76,154
Eventually the voices woke me up; everyone jawing, laughing, telling stories.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[311]:154,209
It was a different vibe, one-eighty from two days ago.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[311]:209,396
I couldn’t really put a finger on what I was feeling, maybe it was what the president said about “reclaiming our future.” I just knew I felt good, better than I had the entire war.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[311]:396,442
I knew it was gonna be a real, long-ass road.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[311]:442,588
I knew our campaign across America was just beginning, but, hey, as the prez said later that first night, it was finally the beginning of the end.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[312]
AINSWORTH, NEBRASKA, USA
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[313]:0,46
[Darnell Hackworth is a shy, soft-spoken man.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[313]:46,140
He and his wife run a retirement farm for the four-legged veterans of the army’s K-9 Corps.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[313]:140,222
Ten years ago farms like these could be found in almost every state in the union.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[313]:222,254
Now, this is the only one left.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[314]:0,39
They never get enough credit, I think.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[314]:39,211
There is that story Dax, nice little children’s book, but it’s pretty simplistic, and it’s only about one Dalmatian that helped an orphan kid find his way to safety.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[314]:211,343
“Dax” wasn’t even in the military, and helping lost children was a tiny fraction of dogs’ overall contribution to the fight.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[315]:0,88
The first thing they used dogs for was triage, letting them sniff for who was infected.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[315]:88,178
Most countries were just copying the Israeli method of sending people past dogs in cages.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[315]:178,294
You always had to keep them in cages, otherwise they might attack the person, or each other, or even their handler.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[315]:294,364
There was a lot of that, early in the war, dogs just going ballistic.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[315]:364,416
It didn’t matter if they were police or military.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[315]:416,479
It’s that instinct, that involuntary, almost genetic terror.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[315]:479,531
Fight or flight, and those dogs were bred to fight.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[315]:531,598
A lot of handlers lost hands, arms, a lot of throats got torn out.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[315]:598,629
Can’t blame the dogs for it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[315]:629,732
In fact, that instinct was what the Israelis were counting on, and it probably saved millions of lives.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[316]:0,88
It was a great program, but, again, just a fraction of what dogs were truly capable of.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[316]:88,257
Whereas the Israelis and, after them, a lot of other countries only tried to exploit that terror instinct, we thought we could integrate it into their regular training.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[316]:257,346
And why not, we learned to do it for ourselves, and are we really that much more evolved?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:0,30
It all came down to training.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:30,124
You had to start young; even the most disciplined, prewar veterans were hardwired berserkers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:124,205
The pups born after the crisis came out of the womb literally smelling the dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:205,320
It was in the air, not enough for us to detect, but just a few molecules, an introduction on a subconscious level.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:320,380
That’s not to say it made all of them automatic warriors.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:380,442
The initial induction was the first and most important phase.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:442,551
You took a group of pups, a random group, or even a whole litter, put them in a room divided by a wire mesh.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:551,597
They’re on one side, Zack’s on the other.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:597,644
You didn’t have to wait long for a reaction.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:644,674
The first group we called Bs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:674,712
They’d start whimpering or howling.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:712,730
They’d lost it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:730,761
They were nothing like the As.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:761,817
Those pups would lock eyes with Zack, that was the key.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[317]:817,1001
They’d stand their ground, bare their teeth, and let out this low growl that said, “Back the fuck off!” They could control themselves, and that was the foundation of our program.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[318]:0,90
Now, just because they could control themselves didn’t mean that we could control them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[318]:90,156
Basic training was pretty much like the standard, prewar program.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[318]:156,178
Could they handle PT?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[318]:178,206
1 Could they follow orders?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[318]:206,276
Did they have the intelligence, and the discipline, to make soldiers?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[318]:276,333
It was hard going, and we had a 60 percent washout rate.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[318]:333,410
It wasn’t uncommon for a recruit to be badly injured, perhaps even killed.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[318]:410,524
A lot of people nowadays call that inhumane, though they don’t seem to have the same sympathy for the handlers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[318]:524,638
Yeah, we had to do it, too, right alongside the dogs, right from day one of Basic, through ten more weeks of AIT.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[318]:638,699
2 It was hard training, especially the Live Enemy Exercises.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[318]:699,855
You know we were the first ones to use Zack in our field training, before the infantry, before the Special Forces, even before the Zoomies at Willow Creek?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[318]:855,948
It was the only way to really know if you could hack it, both as an individual and as a team.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[319]:0,65
How else could you have sent them on so many different missions?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[319]:65,129
There were Lures, the kind that the Battle of Hope made famous.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[319]:129,216
Pretty simple stuff; your partner hunts for Zack, then leads him into our firing line.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[319]:216,299
Ks on early missions used to be fast, run in, bark, then jam it for the kill zone.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[319]:299,333
Later, they got more comfortable.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[319]:333,453
They learned to stay just a few feet ahead, backing away slowly, making sure they herded the maximum amount of targets.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[319]:453,497
In that way, they actually called the shots.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[320]:0,24
There were also Decoys.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[320]:24,119
Let’s say you were setting up a firing line but you didn’t want Zack to show up too early.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[320]:119,210
Your partner would circle around the infested zone and only start barking on the far side.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[320]:210,301
That worked with a lot of engagements, and it opened the door for the “Lemming” tactic.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[321]:0,169
During the Denver push, there was a tall building where a couple hundred refugees had accidentally been locked in with the infection and were now completely reanimated.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[321]:169,354
Before our guys could storm the entrance, one of the Ks had his own idea to run up to the roof of a building across the street and start barking to draw Zack up onto the higher floors.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[321]:354,378
It worked like a dream.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[321]:378,472
The Gs made it up to the roof, saw their prey, made for him, and went spilling over the side.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[321]:472,524
After Denver, Lemming went right into the playbook.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[321]:524,588
Even the infantry started using it when Ks weren’t available.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[321]:588,705
It wasn’t uncommon to see a grunt standing on the roof of a building, calling out to an infested building close by.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[322]:0,85
But the primary and most common mission of any K team was scouting, both SC and LRP.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[322]:85,168
SC is Sweep and Clear, just attached to a regular unit, like conventional warfare.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[322]:168,209
That’s where training really paid off.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[322]:209,326
Not only could they sniff Zack out miles before us, but the sounds they made always told you exactly what to expect.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[322]:326,429
You could tell everything you needed to know by the pitch of the growl, and the frequency of the bark.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[322]:429,502
Sometimes, when silence was required, body language worked just as well.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[322]:502,579
The arch of the K’s back, the raising of dander was all you needed to see.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[322]:579,691
After a few missions, any competent handler, and we had no other kind, could read his partner’s every signal.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[322]:691,786
Scouts finding a ghoul half submerged in mud or legless among tall grass saved a lot of lives.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[322]:786,916
I can’t tell you how many times a grunt would thank us personally for spotting a concealed G that might have taken his foot off.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:0,142
LRP was Long Range Patrol, when your partner would scout far beyond your lines, sometimes even traveling for days, to recon an infested area.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:142,286
They wore a special harness with a video uplink and GPS tracker that gave you real-time intel on the exact number and position of your targets.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:286,409
You could overlay Zack’s position on a preexisting map, coordinating what your partner saw with his position on the GPS.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:409,522
I guess, from a technical side, it was pretty amazing, real-time hard intel like we used to have before the war.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:522,542
The brass loved it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:542,598
I didn’t; I was always too concerned with my partner.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:598,745
I can’t tell you how stressful that was, to be standing in some computer-filled, air-conditioned room—safe, comfortable, and totally helpless.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:745,850
Later harness models had radio uplinks, so a handler could relay orders or, at least, abort the mission.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:850,876
I never worked with them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:876,929
Teams had to be trained on those from the beginning.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:929,978
You couldn’t go back and retrain a seasoned K.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:978,1022
You couldn’t teach an old dog new tricks.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:1022,1039
Sorry, bad joke.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:1039,1251
I heard a lot of those from the intel pukes; standing behind them as they watched the damn monitor, mentally stroking it to the wonders of their new “Data Orientation Asset.” They thought they were so witty.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[323]:1251,1293
Real fun for us to have DOA as an acronym.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[324]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[325]
[He shakes his head.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[326]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[327]:0,125
I just had to stand there, thumb up my ass, watching my partner’s POV as she crept through some forest, or marsh, or town.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[327]:125,165
Towns and cities, that was the hardest.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[327]:165,197
That was my team’s specialty.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[327]:197,209
Hound Town.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[327]:209,232
You ever heard of that?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[328]
The K-9 Urban Warfare School?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[329]:0,44
That’s it, a real town: Mitchell, Oregon.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[329]:44,100
Sealed off, abandoned, and still filled with active Gs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[329]:100,112
Hound Town.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[329]:112,219
It actually should have been called Terrytown, because most of the breeds at Mitchell were small terriers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[329]:219,297
Little cairns and Norwiches and JRs, good for rubble and narrow choke points.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[329]:297,354
Personally, the hound in Hound Town suited me just fine.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[329]:354,378
I worked with a dachle.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[329]:378,430
They were, by far, the ultimate urban war fighters.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[329]:430,510
Tough, smart, and, especially the minis, completely at home in confined spaces.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[329]:510,623
In fact, that’s what they were originally bred for; “badger dog,” that’s what dachshund means in German.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[329]:623,714
That’s why they had that hot dog look, so they could hunt in low, narrow badger burrows.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[329]:714,829
You see how that kind of breeding already made them suited to the ducts and crawl spaces of an urban battleground.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[329]:829,958
The ability to go through a pipe, an airshaft, in between walls, whatever, without losing their cool, was a major survival asset.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[330]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[331]:0,21
[We are interrupted.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[331]:21,73
As if on cue, a dog limps over to Darnell’s side.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[331]:73,85
She is old.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[331]:85,155
Her muzzle is white, the fur on her ears and tail is worn to leather.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[332]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[333]
[To the dog.] Hey, little miss.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[334]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[335]:0,40
[Darnell gingerly lifts her to his lap.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[335]:40,89
She is small, no more than eight or nine pounds.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[335]:89,211
Although she bears some resemblance to a smooth-haired, miniature dachshund, her back is shorter than the standard breed.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[336]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[337]:0,38
[To the dog.] You doin’ okay, Maze?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[337]:38,58
You feel all right?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[337]:58,115
[To me.] Her full name’s Maisey, but we never used it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[337]:115,164
“Maze” was pretty fitting, don’t you think?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[338]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[339]:0,86
[With one hand he massages her back legs while with the other he rubs under her neck.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[339]:86,123
She looks up at him with milky eyes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[339]:123,143
She licks his palm.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[340]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[341]:0,34
Pure bloods were a total washout.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[341]:34,158
Too neurotic, too many health problems, everything you’d expect from breeding an animal for just its aesthetic qualities.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[341]:158,304
The new generation [he gestures to the mutt on his lap] was always a mix, whatever would increase both physical constitution and mental stability.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[342]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[343]:0,28
[The dog has gone to sleep.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[343]:28,54
Darnell lowers his voice.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[344]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[345]:0,106
They were tough, took a lot of training, not just individually but for working in groups on LRP missions.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[345]:106,166
Long range, especially over wild terrain, was always risky.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[345]:166,210
Not just from Zack, but also from feral Ks.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[345]:210,238
Remember how bad they were?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[345]:238,300
All those pets and strays that degenerated into killer packs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[345]:300,418
They were always a concern, usually in transition through low-infestation zones, always looking for something to eat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[345]:418,501
A lot of LRP missions were aborted in the beginning before we deployed escort dogs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[346]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[347]
[He refers to the sleeping dog.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[348]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[349]:0,21
She had two escorts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[349]:21,134
Pongo, who was a pit-rot mix, and Perdy…I don’t really know what Perdy was, part shepherd, part stegosaurus.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[349]:134,233
I wouldn’t have let her anywhere near them if I hadn’t gone through basic with their handlers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[349]:233,275
They turned out to be first-rate escorts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[349]:275,350
Fourteen times they chased off feral packs, twice they really got into it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[349]:350,507
I watched Perdy go after this two-hundred-pound mastiff, grab its skull in her jaws, you could actually hear the crack over the harness’s surveillance mic.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[350]:0,68
The toughest part for me was making sure Maze stuck to the mission.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[350]:68,96
She always wanted to fight.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[350]:96,259
[Smiles down at the sleeping dachshund.] They were good escorts, always made sure she got to her target objective, waited for her, and always got her home safely.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[350]:259,308
You know they even took down a few Gs in transit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[351]
But isn’t Z flesh toxic?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[352]:0,38
Oh yeah…no, no, no, they never bit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[352]:38,66
That would have been fatal.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[352]:66,198
You’d see a lot of dead Ks in the beginning of the war, just lying there, no wounds, and you knew they’d bitten infected flesh.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[352]:198,253
That’s one of the reasons training was so important.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[352]:253,296
They had to know how to defend themselves.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[352]:296,372
Zack’s got a lot of physical advantages, but balance isn’t one of them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[352]:372,489
The bigger Ks could always hit between the shoulder blades or the small of the back, just knock them on their faces.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[352]:489,587
The minis had the option of tripping, getting underfoot, or launching themselves at the knee-pit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[352]:587,650
Maze always preferred that, dropped ’em right on their backs!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[353]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[354]
[The dog stirs.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[355]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[356]:0,35
[To Maze.] Oh, sorry, little miss.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[356]:35,66
[Strokes the back of her neck.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[357]
[To me.] By the time Zack got back up, you’d bought yourself five, maybe ten, fifteen seconds.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[358]:0,32
We had our share of casualties.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[358]:32,181
Some Ks would have a fall, break a bone…If they were close to friendly forces, their handler could pick them up pretty easily, get them to safety.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[358]:181,232
Most of the time they even returned to active duty.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[359]
What about the other times?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[360]:0,245
If they were too far, a Lure or an LRP…too far for rescue and too close to Zack…we petitioned for Mercy Charges, little explosive packs strapped to the harness so we could detonate them if it looked like there wasn’t any chance of rescue.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[360]:245,264
We never got them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[360]:264,314
“A waste of valuable resources.” Cocksuckers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[360]:314,430
Putting a wounded soldier out of his misery was a waste but turning them into Fragmuts, now, that they’d consider!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[361]
Excuse me?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[362]:0,102
“Fragmuts.” That was the unofficial name for the program that almost, almost got the green light.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[362]:102,271
Some staff asshole’d read that the Russians had used “mine dogs” during World War II, strapped explosives to their backs and trained them to run under Nazi tanks.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[362]:271,397
The only reason Ivan ended his program was the same reason we never began ours: the situation was no longer desperate enough.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[362]:397,437
How fucking desperate do you have to be?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[363]:0,98
They’ll never say it, but I think what stopped them was the threat of another Eckhart incident.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[363]:98,125
That really woke ’em up.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[363]:125,153
You know about that, right?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[363]:153,186
Sergeant Eckhart, God bless her.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[363]:186,234
She was a senior handler, operated up with AGN.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[363]:234,253
3 I never met her.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[363]:253,345
Her partner was pulling a Lure mission outside Little Rock, fell in a ditch, broke his leg.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[363]:345,382
The swarm was only a few steps away.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[363]:382,434
Eckhart grabbed a rifle, tried to go out after him.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[363]:434,517
Some officer got in her face, started spouting regs and half-assed justifications.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[363]:517,555
She emptied half a clip in his mouth.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[363]:555,600
MPs tackled her ass, held her on the ground.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[363]:600,661
She could hear everything as the dead surrounded her partner.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[364]
What happened?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:0,52
They hung her, public execution, real high profile.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:52,83
I understand, no, I really do.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:83,144
Discipline was everything, rule of law, that’s all we had.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:144,200
But you better fucking believe there were some changes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:200,292
Handlers were allowed to go after their partners, even if it meant risking their own lives.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:292,353
We weren’t considered assets anymore, we were half-assets.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:353,573
For the first time the army saw us as teams, that a dog wasn’t just a piece of machinery you could replace when “broken.” They started looking at statistics of handlers who offed themselves after losing a partner.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:573,650
You know we had the highest rate of suicide among any branch of the service.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:650,754
More than Special Forces, more than Graves Registration, even more than those sick fucks at China Lake.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:754,816
4 At Hound Town I met handlers from thirteen other countries.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:816,846
They all said the same thing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:846,953
It didn’t matter where you were from, what your culture or background, the feelings were still the same.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:953,1015
Who could suffer that kind of loss and come out in one piece?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:1015,1083
Anyone who could wouldn’t have made a handler in the first place.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:1083,1203
That’s what made us our own breed, that ability to bond so strongly with something that’s not even our own species.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:1203,1356
The very thing that made so many of my friends take the bullet’s way out was what made us one of the most successful outfits in the whole fucking U.S.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[365]:1356,1365
military.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[366]:0,96
The army saw it in me that day on a stretch of deserted road somewhere in the Colorado Rockies.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[366]:96,200
I’d been on foot since escaping my apartment in Atlanta, three months of running, hiding, scavenging.

I had rickets, fever, I was down to ninety-six pounds.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[366]:255,292
I found these two guys under a tree.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[366]:292,317
They were making a fire.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[366]:317,351
Behind them was this little mutt.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[366]:351,397
His paws and snout were bound with shoelaces.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[366]:397,432
Dried blood was caked on his face.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[366]:432,488
He was just lying there, glassy-eyed, whimpering softly.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[367]
What happened?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[368]:0,39
You know, I honestly don’t remember.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[368]:39,80
I must have hit one of them with my bat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[368]:80,121
They found it cracked over his shoulder.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[368]:121,180
They found me on the other guy, just pounding his face in.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[368]:180,268
Ninety-six pounds, half dead myself, and I beat this guy to within an inch of his life.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[368]:268,371
The Guardsmen had to pull me off, cuff me to a car hulk, smack me a couple times to get me to refocus.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[368]:371,389
That, I remember.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[368]:389,482
One of the guys I attacked was holding his arm, the other one was just lying there bleeding.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[368]:482,572
“Calm the fuck down,” the LT said, trying to question me, “What’s wrong with you?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[368]:572,758
Why’d you do that to your friends?” “He’s not our friend!” the one with the broken arm yelled, “he’s fuckin’ crazy!” And all I kept saying was “Don’t hurt the dog!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[368]:758,822
Don’t hurt the dog!” I remember the Guardsmen just laughed.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[368]:822,889
“Jesus Christ,” one of them said looking down at the two guys.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[368]:889,923
The LT nodded, then looked at me.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[368]:923,1015
“Buddy,” he said, “I think we got a job for you.” And that’s how I got recruited.

What happened to the dog?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[373]:0,130
I wish I could give you a Disney ending, like he became my partner or ended up saving a whole orphanage from a fire or something.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[373]:130,177
They’d hit him with a rock to knock him out.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[373]:177,211
Fluid built up in his ear canals.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[373]:211,272
He lost all hearing in one and partial hearing in the other.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[373]:272,360
But his nose still worked and he did make a pretty good ratter once I found him a home.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[373]:360,420
He hunted enough vermin to keep that family fed all winter.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[373]:420,488
That’s kind of a Disney ending, I guess, Disney with Mickey stew.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[373]:488,537
[Laughs softly.] You wanna know something crazy?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[373]:537,557
I used to hate dogs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[374]
Really?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[375]:0,109
Despised them; dirty, smelly, slobbering germ bags that humped your leg and made the carpet smell like piss.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[375]:109,128
God, I hated them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[375]:128,202
I was that guy who’d come over to your house and refuse to pet the dog.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[375]:202,287
I was the guy at work who always made fun of people with dog pictures on their desk.

I lived a block away from a pet store.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[379]:39,217
I used to drive by it every day on my way to work, confounded by how these sentimental, socially incompetent losers could shell out so much money on oversized, barking hamsters.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[379]:217,285
During the Panic, the dead started to collect around that pet shop.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[379]:285,321
I don’t know where the owner was.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[379]:321,379
He’d pulled down the gates but left the animals inside.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[379]:379,421
I could hear them from my bedroom window.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[379]:421,441
All day, all night.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[379]:441,488
Just puppies, you know, a couple of weeks old.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[379]:488,579
Scared little babies screaming for their mommies, for anyone, to please come and save them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[380]:0,61
I heard them die, one by one as their water bottles ran out.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[380]:61,84
The dead never got in.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[380]:84,181
They were still massed outside the gate when I escaped, ran right past without stopping to look.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[380]:181,205
What could I have done?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[380]:205,231

I could barely take care of myself.

In order to understand how we became a “religious state,” and how that state began with a man like me, you have to understand the nature of our war against the undead.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[389]:0,71
As with so many other conflicts, our greatest ally was General Winter.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[389]:71,217
The biting cold, lengthened and strengthened by the planet’s darkened skies, gave us the time we needed to prepare our homeland for liberation.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[389]:217,281
Unlike the United States, we were fighting a war on two fronts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[389]:281,359
We had the Ural barrier in the west, and the Asian swarms from the southeast.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[389]:359,436
Siberia had been stabilized, finally, but was by no means completely secure.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[389]:436,552
We had so many refugees from India and China, so many frozen ghouls that thawed, and continue to thaw, each spring.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[389]:552,694
We needed those winter months to reorganize our forces, marshal our population, inventory and distribute our vast stocks of military hardware.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[390]:0,56
We didn’t have the war production of other countries.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[390]:56,183
There was no Department of Strategic Resources in Russia: no industry other than finding enough food to keep our people alive.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[390]:183,247
What we did have was our legacy of a military industrial state.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[390]:247,648
I know you in the West have always laughed at us for this “folly.” “Paranoid Ivan”—that’s what you called us—“building tanks and guns while his people cry out for cars and butter.” Yes, the Soviet Union was backward and inefficient and yes, it did bankrupt our economy on mountains of military might, but when the motherland needed them, those mountains were what saved her children.

I was a chaplain with the Thirty-second Motor Rifle division.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[394]:62,140
We were a Category D unit; fourth-class equipment, the oldest in our arsenal.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[394]:140,269
We looked like extras in an old Great Patriotic War movie with our PPSH submachine guns and our bolt-action Mosin-Nagant rifles.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[394]:269,324
We didn’t have your fancy, new battle dress uniform.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[394]:324,472
We wore the tunics of our grandfathers: rough, moldy, moth-eaten wool that could barely keep the cold out, and did nothing to protect against bites.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[395]:0,105
We had a very high casualty rate, most of it in urban combat, and most of that due to faulty ammunition.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[395]:105,240
Those rounds were older than us; some of them had been sitting in crates, open to the elements, since before Stalin breathed his last.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[395]:240,359
You never knew when a “Cugov” would happen, when your weapon would “click” at the moment a ghoul was upon you.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[395]:359,421
That happened a lot in the Thirty-second Motor Rifle division.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[396]:0,49
We weren’t as neat and organized as your army.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[396]:49,166
We didn’t have your tight, light little Raj-Singh squares or your frugal “one shot, one kill” combat doctrine.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[396]:166,202
Our battles were sloppy and brutal.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[396]:202,376
We plastered the enemy in DShK heavy machine-gun fire, drowned them with flamethrowers and Katyusha rockets, and crushed them under the treads of our prehistoric T-34 tanks.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[396]:376,449
It was inefficient and wasteful and resulted in too many needless deaths.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[397]:0,49
Ufa was the first major battle of our offensive.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[397]:49,146
It became the reason we stopped going into the cities and started walling them up during winter.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[397]:146,319
We learned a lot of lessons those first months, charging headlong into the rubble after hours of merciless artillery, fighting block by block, house by house, room by room.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[397]:319,406
There were always too many zombies, too many misfires, and always too many bitten boys.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[398]:0,46
We didn’t have L pills 1 like in your army.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[398]:46,96
The only way to deal with infection was a bullet.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[398]:96,135
But who was going to pull the trigger?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[398]:135,169
Certainly not the other soldiers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[398]:169,271
To kill your comrade, even in cases as merciful as infection, was too reminiscent of the decimations.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[398]:271,301
That was the irony of it all.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[398]:301,424
The decimations had given our armed forces the strength and discipline to do anything we asked of them, anything but that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[398]:424,534
To ask, or even order, one soldier to kill another was crossing a line that might have sparked another mutiny.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[399]:0,94
For a while the responsibility rested with the leadership, the officers and senior sergeants.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[399]:94,144
We couldn’t have made a more damaging decision.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[399]:144,332
To have to look into the faces of these men, these boys whom you were responsible for, whom you fought with side by side, shared bread and blankets, saved his life or have him save yours.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[399]:332,420
Who can focus on the monumental burden of leadership after having to commit such an act?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[400]:0,69
We began to see a noticeable degradation among our field commanders.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[400]:69,168
Dereliction of duty, alcoholism, suicide—suicide became almost epidemic among the officer corps.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[400]:168,300
Our division lost four experienced leaders, three junior lieutenants, and a major, all during the first week of our first campaign.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[400]:300,409
Two of the lieutenants shot themselves, one right after committing the deed, and the other later that night.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[400]:409,630
The third platoon leader chose a more passive method, what we began to call “suicide by combat.” He volunteered for increasingly dangerous missions, acting more like a reckless enlisted man than a responsible leader.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[400]:630,698
He died trying to take on a dozen ghouls with nothing but a bayonet.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:0,28
Major Kovpak just vanished.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:28,55
No one knows exactly when.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:55,94
We knew he couldn’t have been taken.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:94,192
The area was thoroughly swept and no one, absolutely no one left the perimeter without an escort.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:192,228
We all knew what probably happened.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:228,358
Colonel Savichev put out an official statement that the major had been sent on a long-range recon mission and had never returned.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:358,437
He even went so far as to recommend him for a first-class Order of the Rodina.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:437,563
You can’t stop the rumors, and nothing is worse for a unit’s morale than to know that one of their officers had deserted.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:563,606
I could not blame the man, I still cannot.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:606,646
Kovpak was a good man, a strong leader.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:646,721
Before the crisis he had done three tours in Chechnya and one in Dagestan.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:721,941
When the dead began to rise, he not only prevented his company from revolting, but led them all, on foot, carrying both supplies and wounded from Curta in the Salib Mountains all the way to Manaskent on the Caspian Sea.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:941,990
Sixty-five days, thirty-seven major engagements.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:990,1004
Thirty-seven!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:1004,1155
He could have become an instructor—he’d more than earned the right—and had even been asked by STAVKA because of his extensive combat experience.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:1155,1213
But no, he volunteered for an immediate return to action.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:1213,1240
And now he was a deserter.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[401]:1240,1439
They used to call this “the Second Decimation,” the fact that almost one in every ten officers killed themselves in those days, a decimation that almost brought our war effort to a crushing halt.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[402]:0,96
The logical alternative, the only one, was to therefore let the boys commit the act themselves.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[402]:96,224
I can still remember their faces, dirty and pimply, their red-rimmed eyes wide as they closed their mouths around their rifles.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[402]:224,249
What else could be done?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[402]:249,452
It wasn’t long before they began to kill themselves in groups, all those who’d been bitten in a battle gathering at the field hospital to synchronize the moment when they would all pull the trigger.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[402]:452,520
I guess it was comforting, knowing that they weren’t dying alone.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[402]:520,572
It was probably the only comfort they could expect.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[402]:572,611
They certainly didn’t get it from me.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[403]:0,71
I was a religious man in a country that had long since lost its faith.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[403]:71,381
Decades of communism followed by materialistic democracy had left this generation of Russians with little knowledge of, or need for, “the opium of the masses.” As a chaplain, my duties were mainly to collect letters from the condemned boys to their families, and to distribute any vodka I managed to find.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[403]:381,507
It was a next-to-useless existence, I knew, and the way our country was headed, I doubted anything would occur to change that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:0,100
It was right after the battle for Kostroma, just a few weeks before the official assault on Moscow.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:100,170
I had come to the field hospital to give last rights to the infected.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:170,244
They had been set apart, some badly mauled, some still healthy and lucid.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:244,301
The first boy couldn’t have been older than seventeen.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:301,352
He wasn’t bitten, that would have been merciful.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:352,442
The zombie had had its forearms ripped off by the treads of an SU-152 self-propelled gun.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:442,544
All that remained was hanging flesh and broken humerus bones, jagged at the edges, sharp like spears.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:544,636
They stabbed right through the boy’s tunic where whole hands would have just grabbed him.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:636,726
He was lying on a cot, bleeding from his belly, ashen-faced, rifle quivering in his hand.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:726,781
Next to him was a row of five other infected soldiers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:781,854
I went through the motions of telling them I would pray for their souls.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:854,895
They either shrugged or nodded politely.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:895,1029
I took their letters, as I’d always done, gave them a drink, and even passed out a couple cigarettes from their commanding officer.

Even though I’d done this many times, somehow I felt strangely different.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:1105,1225
Something was stirring within me, a tense, tingling sensation that began to work its way up through my heart and lungs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:1225,1343
I began to feel my whole body tremble as the soldiers all placed the muzzles of their weapons underneath their chins.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:1343,1384
“On three,” the oldest of them said.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:1384,1432
“One…two…” That was as far as they got.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:1432,1489
The seventeen-year-old flew backward and hit the ground.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[404]:1489,1613
The others stared dumbfounded at the bullet hole in his forehead, then up to the smoking pistol in my hand, in God’s hand.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[405]:0,67
God was speaking to me, I could feel his words ringing in my head.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[405]:67,168
“No more sinning,” he told me, “no more souls resigned to hell.” It was so clear, so simple.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[405]:168,301
Officers killing soldiers had cost us too many good officers, and soldiers killing themselves had cost the Lord too many good souls.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[405]:301,495
Suicide was a sin, and we, his servants—those who had chosen to be his shepherds upon the earth—were the only ones who should bear the cross of releasing trapped souls from infected bodies!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[405]:495,703
That is what I told division commander after he discovered what I’d done, and that is the message that spread first to every chaplain in the field and then to every civilian priest throughout Mother Russia.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[406]:0,170
What later became known as the act of “Final Purification” was only the first step of a religious fervor that would surpass even the Iranian revolution of the 1980s.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[406]:170,231
God knew his children had been denied his love for too long.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[406]:231,269
They needed direction, courage, hope!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[406]:269,420
You could say that it is the reason we emerged from that war as a nation of faith, and have continued to rebuild our state, on the basis of that faith.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[407]
Is there any truth to the stories of that philosophy being perverted for political reasons?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[408]
[Pause.] I don’t understand.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[409]
The president declared himself head of the Church…
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[410]
Can’t a national leader feel God’s love?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[411]
But what about organizing priests into “death squads,” and assassinating people under the premise of “purifying infected victims”?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[412]
[Pause.] I don’t know what you’re talking about.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[413]:0,54
Isn’t that why you eventually fell out with Moscow?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[413]:54,85
Isn’t that why you’re here?

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[414]:0,24
[There is a long pause.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[414]:24,69
We hear the sounds of footsteps approaching.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[414]:69,97
Someone knocks at the door.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[414]:97,151
Father Sergei opens it to find a small, ragged child.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[414]:151,189
Mud stains his pale, frightened face.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[414]:189,263
He speaks in a frantic, local dialect, shouting and pointing up the road.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[414]:263,341
The old priest nods solemnly, pats the boy on the shoulder, then turns to me.]

[Deep Glider 7 looks more like a twin fuselage aircraft than a minisub.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[420]:72,167
I lie on my stomach in the starboard hull, looking out through a thick, transparent nose cone.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[420]:167,250
My pilot, Master Chief Petty Officer Michael Choi, waves at me from the port hull.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[420]:250,335
Choi is one of the “old-timers,” possibly the most experienced diver in the U.S.

Navy’s Deep Submergence Combat Corps (DSCC).

My war never ended.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[422]:20,72
If anything, you could say it’s still escalating.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[422]:72,152
Every month we expand our operations and improve our material and human assets.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[422]:152,301
They say there are still somewhere between twenty and thirty million of them, still washing up on beaches, or getting snagged in fishermen’s nets.

You can’t work an offshore oil rig or repair a transatlantic cable without running into a swarm.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[422]:400,537
That’s what this dive is about: trying to find them, track them, and predict their movements so maybe we can have some advance warning.

You’re not going to ask me about scuba gear or titanium shark suits, are you, because that crap’s got nothing to do with my war?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[426]:133,221
Spear guns and bang sticks and zombie river nets…I can’t help you with any of that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[426]:221,262
If you want civilians, talk to civilians.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[427]
But the military did use those methods.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[428]:0,64
Only for brown water ops, and almost exclusively by army pukes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[428]:64,154
Personally, I’ve never worn a mesh suit or a scuba rig…well…at least not in combat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[428]:154,179
My war was strictly ADS.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[428]:179,204
Atmospheric Diving Suit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[428]:204,271
Kind of like a space suit and a suit of armor all rolled into one.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[428]:271,395
The technology actually goes back a couple hundred years, when some guy 1 invented a barrel with a faceplate and arm holes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[428]:395,463
After that you had stuff like the Tritonia and the Neufeldt-Kuhnke.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[428]:463,556
They looked like something out of an old 1950s sci-fi movie, “Robby the Robot” and shit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[428]:556,630
It all kinda fell by the wayside when…do you really care about all this?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[429]
Yes, please…
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[430]:0,75
Well, that sort of technology fell by the wayside when scuba was invented.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[430]:75,168
It only made a comeback when divers had to go deep, real deep, to work on offshore oil rigs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[430]:168,311
You see…the deeper you go, the greater the pressure; the greater the pressure, the more dangerous it is for scuba or similar mixed-gas rigs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[430]:311,649
You’ve got to spend days, sometimes weeks, in a decompression chamber, and if, for some reason, you have to shoot up to the surface…you get the bends, gas bubbles in the blood, in the brain…and we’re not even talking about long-term health hazards like bone necrosis, soaking your body with shit nature never intended to be there.
====

[He pauses to check his instruments.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[433]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[434]
The safest way to dive, to go deeper, to stay down longer, was to enclose your whole body in a bubble of surface pressure.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[435]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[436]
[He gestures to the compartments around us.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[437]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[438]:0,96
Just like we are now—safe, protected, still on the surface as far as our bodies’ concerned.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[438]:96,185
That’s what an ADS does, its depth and duration only limited by armor and life support.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[439]
So it’s like a personal submarine?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[440]:0,103
“Submersible.” A submarine can stay down for years, maintaining its own power, making its own air.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[440]:103,199
A submersible can only make short duration dives, like World War II subs or what we’re in now.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[441]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[442]
[The water begins to darken, deepening to a purplish ink.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[443]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[444]:0,125
The very nature of an ADS, the fact that it’s really just a suit of armor, makes it ideal for blue and black water combat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[444]:125,192
I’m not knocking soft suits, you know, shark or other mesh rigs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[444]:192,455
They’ve got ten times the maneuverability, the speed, the agility, but they’re strictly shallow water at best, and if for some reason a couple of those fuckers get ahold of you…I’ve seen mesh divers with broken arms, broken ribs, three with broken necks.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[444]:455,544
Drowning…if your air line was punctured or the regulator’s ripped out of your mouth.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[444]:544,656
Even in a hard helmet on a mesh-lined dry suit, all they’d have to do is hold you down, let your air run out.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[444]:656,780
I’ve seen too many guys go out that way, or else try to race for the surface and let an embolism finish what Zack started.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[445]
Did that happen a lot to mesh suit divers?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[446]:0,69
Sometimes, especially in the beginning, but it never happened to us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[446]:69,107
There was no risk of physical danger.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[446]:107,209
Both your body and your life support are encased in a cast-aluminum or high-strength composite shell.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[446]:209,254
Most models’ joints are steel or titanium.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[446]:254,449
No matter which way Zack turned your arms, even if he managed to get a solid grip, which is hard considering how smooth and round everything is, it was physically impossible to break off a limb.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[446]:449,604
If for some reason you need to jet up to the surface, just jettison your ballast or your thruster pack, if you had one…all suits are positively buoyant.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[446]:604,635
They pop right up like a cork.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[446]:635,706
The only risk might be if Zack were clinging to you during the ascent.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[446]:706,813
A couple times I’ve had buddies surface with uninvited passengers hanging on for dear life…or undeath.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[446]:813,824
[Chuckles.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[447]:0,49
Balloon ascents almost never happened in combat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[447]:49,112
Most ADS models have forty-eight hours emergency life support.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[447]:112,314
No matter how many Gs dog-piled you, no matter if a hunk of debris came crumbling down or your leg got snagged in an underwater cable, you could sit tight, snug and safe, and just wait for the cavalry.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[447]:314,423
No one ever dives alone, and I think the longest any ADS diver has ever had to cool his heels was six hours.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[447]:423,668
There were times, more than I can count on my fingers, where one of us would get snagged, report it, then follow up by saying that there was no immediate danger, and that the rest of the team should assist only after accomplishing their mission.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[448]:0,20
You say ADS models.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[448]:20,49
Was there more than one type?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[449]:0,70
We had a bunch: civilian, military, old, new…well…relatively new.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[449]:70,161
We couldn’t build any wartime models, so we had to work with what was already available.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[449]:161,287
Some of the older ones dated back to the seventies, the JIMs and SAMs. I’m really glad I never had to operate any of those.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[449]:287,439
They only had universal joints and portholes instead of a face bowl, at least on the early JIMs. I knew one guy, from the British Special Boat Service.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[449]:439,552
He had these mondo blood blisters all along his inner thighs from where the JIM’s leg joints pinched his skin.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[449]:552,614
Kick-ass divers, the SBS, but I’d never swap jobs with them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[450]:0,24
We had three basic U.S.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[450]:24,90
Navy models: the Hardsuit 1200, the 2000, and the Mark 1 Exosuit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[450]:90,117
That was my baby, the exo.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[450]:117,212
You wanna talk about sci-fi, this thing looked like it was made to fight giant space termites.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[450]:212,309
It was much slimmer than either of the two hardsuits, and light enough that you could even swim.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[450]:309,556
That was the major advantage over the hardsuit, actually over all other ADS systems. To be able to operate above your enemy, even without a power sled or thruster packs, that more than made up for the fact that you couldn’t scratch your itches.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[450]:556,686
The hardsuits were big enough to allow your arms to be pulled into the central cavity to allow you to operate secondary equipment.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[451]
What kind of equipment?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[452]:0,36
Lights, video, side scanning sonar.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[452]:36,107
The hardsuits were full-service units, exos were the bargain basement.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[452]:107,173
You didn’t have to worry about a lot of readouts and machinery.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[452]:173,253
You didn’t have any of the distractions or the multitasking of the hardsuits.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[452]:253,350
The exo was sleek and simple, allowing you to focus on your weapon and the field in front of you.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[453]
What kind of weapons did you use?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[454]:0,81
At first we had the M-9, kind of a cheap, modified, knockoff of the Russian APS.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[454]:81,157
I say “modified” because no ADS had anything close to resembling hands.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[454]:157,222
You either had four-pronged claws or simple, industrial pincers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[454]:222,340
Both worked as hand-to-hand weapons—just grab a G’s head and squeeze—but they made it impossible to fire a gun.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[454]:340,407
The M-9 was fixed to your forearm and could be fired electrically.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[454]:407,514
It had a laser pointer for accuracy and air-encased cartridges that fired these four-inch-long steel rods.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[454]:514,600
The major problem was that they were basically designed for shallow water operations.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[454]:600,654
At the depth we needed, they imploded like eggshells.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[454]:654,790
About a year in we got a much more efficient model, the M-11, actually invented by the same guy who invented both the hardsuit and exo.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[454]:790,869
I hope that crazy Canuck got an assload of medals for what he’s done for us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[454]:869,949
The only problem with it was that DeStRes thought production was too expensive.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[454]:949,1068
They kept telling us that between our claws and preexisting construction tools, we had more than enough to handle Zack.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[455]
What changed their minds?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[456]:0,7
Troll.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[456]:7,239
We were in the North Sea, repairing that Norwegian natural gas platform, and suddenly there they were…We’d expected some kind of attack—the noise and light of the construction site always attracted at least a handful of them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[456]:239,276
We didn’t know a swarm was nearby.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[456]:276,367
One of our sentries sounded off, we headed for his beacon, and we were suddenly inundated.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[456]:367,416
Horrible thing to fight hand-to-hand underwater.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[456]:416,501
The bottom churns up, your visibility is shot, like fighting inside a glass of milk.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[456]:501,671
Zombies don’t just die when you hit them, most of the time they disintegrate, fragments of muscle, organ, brain matter, mixed up with the silt and swirling around you.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[456]:671,903
Kids today…fuckin’ A, I sound like my pops, but it’s true, the kids today, the new ADS divers in the Mark 3s and 4s, they have this “ZeVDeK”—Zero Visibility Detection Kit—with color-imaging sonar and low-light optics.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[456]:903,999
The picture is relayed through a heads-up display right on your face bowl like a fighter plane.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[456]:999,1090
Throw in a pair of stereo hydrophones and you’ve got a real sensory advantage over Zack.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[456]:1090,1135
That was not the case when I first went exo.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[456]:1135,1240
We couldn’t see, we couldn’t hear—we couldn’t even feel if a G was trying to grab us from behind.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[457]
Why was that?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[458]:0,73
Because the one fundamental flaw of an ADS is complete tactile blackout.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[458]:73,207
The simple fact that the suit is hard means you can’t feel anything from the outside world, even if a G has his hands right on you.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[458]:207,356
Unless Zack is actively tugging, trying to pull you back or flip you around, you may not know he’s there until his face is right up against yours.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[458]:356,495
That night at Troll…our helmet lights only made the problem worse by throwing up a glare that was only broken by an undead hand or face.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[458]:495,670
That was the only time I was ever spooked…not scared, you understand, just spooked, swinging in this liquid chalk and suddenly a rotting face is jammed against my face bowl.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[459]:0,135
The civilian oil workers, they wouldn’t go back to work, even under threat of reprisals, until we, their escorts, were better armed.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[459]:135,211
They’d lost enough of their people already, ambushed out of the darkness.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[459]:211,258
Can’t imagine what that must have been like.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[459]:258,451
You’re in this dry suit, working in near pitch-black, eyes stinging from the light of the welding torch, body numb from the cold or else burning from the hot water pumped through the system.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[459]:451,492
Suddenly you feel these hands, or teeth.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[459]:492,563
You struggle, call for help, try to fight or swim as they pull you up.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[459]:563,661
Maybe a few body parts will rise to the surface, maybe they’ll just pull up a severed lifeline.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[459]:661,722
That was how the DSCC came into being as an official outfit.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[459]:722,793
Our first mission was to protect the rig divers, keep the oil flowing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[459]:793,855
Later we expanded to beachhead sanitation and harbor clearing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[460]
What is beachhead sanitation?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[461]:0,44
Basically, helping the jarheads get ashore.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[461]:44,193
What we learned during Bermuda, our first amphibious landing, was that the beachhead was coming under constant attack by Gs walking out of the surf.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[461]:193,356
We had to establish a perimeter, a semicircular net around the proposed landing area that was deep enough for ships to pass over, but high enough to keep out Zack.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[462]:0,27
That’s where we came in.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[462]:27,160
Two weeks before the landings took place, a ship would anchor several miles offshore and start banging away with their active sonar.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[462]:160,202
That was to draw Zack away from the beach.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[463]
Wouldn’t that sonar also lure in zombies from deeper water?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[464]:0,97
The brass told us that was an “acceptable risk.” I think they didn’t have anything better.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[464]:97,155
That’s why it was an ADS op, too risky for mesh divers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[464]:155,291
You knew that masses were gathering under that pinging ship, and that once they went silent, you’d be the brightest target out there.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[464]:291,365
It actually turned out to be the closest thing we ever had to a cakewalk.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[464]:365,477
The attack frequency was the lowest by far, and when the nets were up, they had an almost perfect success rate.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[464]:477,599
All you needed was a skeleton force to keep a constant vigil, maybe snipe the occasional G that tried to climb the fence.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[464]:599,649
They didn’t really need us for this kind of op.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[464]:649,717
After the first three landings, they went back to using mesh divers.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[465]
And harbor clearing?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:0,25
That was not a cakewalk.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:25,161
That was in the final stages of the war, when it wasn’t just about opening a beachhead, but reopening harbors for deepwater shipping.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:161,296
That was a massive, combined operation: mesh divers, ADS units, even civilian volunteers with nothing but a scuba rig and a spear gun.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:296,419
I helped clear Charleston, Norfolk, Boston, freakin’ Boston, and the mother of all subsurface nightmares, the Hero City.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:419,590
I know grunts like to bitch about fighting to clear a city, but imagine a city underwater, a city of sunken ships and cars and planes and every kind of debris imaginable.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:590,735
During the evacuation, when a lot of container ships were trying to make as much room as they could, a lot of them dumped their cargo overboard.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:735,795
Couches, toaster ovens, mountains and mountains of clothes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:795,849
Plasma TVs always crunched when you walked over them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:849,880
I always imagined it was bone.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:880,996
I also imagined I could see Zack behind each washer and dryer, climbing over each pile of smashed air conditioners.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:996,1107
Sometimes it was just my imagination, but sometimes…The worst…the worst was having to clear a sunken ship.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:1107,1180
There were always a few that had gone down within the harbor boundaries.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:1180,1296
A couple, like the Frank Cable, big sub tender turned refugee ship, had gone down right at the mouth of the harbor.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:1296,1373
Before she could be raised, we had to do a compartment-by-compartment sweep.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:1373,1431
That was the only time the exo ever felt bulky, unwieldy.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:1431,1511
I didn’t smack my head in every passageway, but it sure as hell felt like it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:1511,1556
A lot of the hatches were blocked by debris.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:1556,1635
We either had to cut our way through them, or through the decks and bulkheads.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:1635,1696
Sometimes the deck had been weakened by damage or corrosion.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:1696,1809
I was cutting through a bulkhead above the Cable’s engine room when suddenly the deck just collapsed under me.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:1809,1901
Before I could swim, before I could think…there were hundreds of them in the engine room.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:1901,1962
I was engulfed, drowning in legs and arms and hunks of meat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[466]:1962,2147
If I ever had a recurring nightmare, and I’m not saying I do, because I don’t, but if I did, I’d be right back in there, only this time I’m completely naked…I mean I would be.

It looks like a desert wasteland, glowing white against the permanent darkness.

I can see the dim red beam of the laser as it settles on the first target.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[476]:168,222
A second later, a small dart is fired into its chest.]

Kills me not to kill them.

I mean, I know the whole point is to study their movements, set up an early warning network.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[486]:120,184
I know that if we had the resources to clear them all we would.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[486]:184,192
Still…

And why do they have such a resistance to pressure anyway?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[494]:147,220
At this depth the human nervous system should be completely Jell-O-ized.

They shouldn’t even be able to stand, let alone walk and “think” or whatever their version of thinking is.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[494]:333,352
How do they do it?

Yes, there’s aesthetics, a sense of continuity and civic pride…not like that architectural mongrel called London.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[518]:335,509
But the truth, the logical, practical, reason for keeping Paris free from American-style monoliths, is that the earth beneath their feet is simply too tunneled to support it.

Then there is the modern Metro, the telephone lines, the gas mains, the water pipes…and through it all, you have the catacombs.

Roughly six million bodies were buried there, taken from the prerevolution cemeteries, where corpses were just tossed in like rubbish.

The word spread, “it’s safe underground.” A quarter million in all, that’s what the bone counters have determined, two hundred and fifty thousand refugees.

Sometimes it was only a few minutes, sometimes hours, or even days.

At least with the radio, you could try, maybe, to get a fix on your comrades’ position.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[525]:335,422
If they weren’t panicked, if they knew where they were, if you knew where you were…
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[526]:0,194
The running: you dash through the passageways, bash your head on the ceiling, crawl on your hands and knees, praying to the Virgin with all your might for them to hold for just a little longer.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[526]:194,315
You get to their position, find it is the wrong one, an empty chamber, and the screams for help are still a long way off.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[527]:0,64
And when you arrive, maybe to find nothing but bones and blood.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[527]:64,242
Maybe you are lucky to find the zombies still there, a chance for vengeance…if it has taken a long time to reach them, that vengeance must now include your reanimated friends.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[527]:242,256
Close combat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[527]:256,272
Close like so…
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[528]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[529]
[He leans across the table, pressing his face inches away from mine.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[530]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[531]:0,61
No standard equipment; whatever one believed would suit him.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[531]:61,101
There were no firearms, you understand.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[531]:101,141
The air, the gas, it was too flammable.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[531]:141,163
The fire from a gun…
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[532]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[533]
[He makes the sound of an explosion.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[534]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[535]:0,53
We had the Beretta-Grechio, the Italian air carbine.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[535]:53,118
It was a wartime model of a child’s carbon dioxide pellet gun.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[535]:118,200
You got maybe five shots, six or seven if it was pressed right up to their heads.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[535]:200,244
Good weapon, but always not enough of them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[535]:244,271
And you had to be careful!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[535]:271,480
If you missed, if the ball struck the stone, if the stone was dry, if you got a spark…entire tunnels would catch, explosions that buried men alive, or fireballs that melted their masks right to their faces.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[535]:480,511
Hand to hand is always better.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[535]:511,518
Here…
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[536]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[537]:0,66
[He rises from the table to show me something on his mantelpiece.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[537]:66,129
The weapon’s handle is encased in a semicircular steel ball.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[537]:129,216
Protruding from this ball are two 8-inch steel spikes at right angles from each other.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[538]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[539]:0,17
You see why, eh?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[539]:17,43
No room to swing a blade.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[539]:43,95
Quick, through the eye, or over the top of the head.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[540]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[541]
[He demonstrates with a quick punch and stab combination.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[542]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[543]:0,75
My own design, a modern version of my great-grandfather’s at Verdun, eh?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[543]:75,138
You know Verdun—“On ne passé pas”—They shall not pass!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[544]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[545]
[He resumes his lunch.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[546]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[547]:0,147
No room, no warning, suddenly they are upon you, perhaps right in front of your eyes, or grabbing from a side passage you didn’t know was there.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[547]:147,326
Everyone was armored in some way…chain mail or heavy leather…almost always it was too heavy, too suffocating, wet leather jackets and trousers, heavy metal chain-link shirts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[547]:326,440
You try to fight, you are already exhausted, men would tear off their masks, gasping for air, inhaling the stink.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[547]:440,491
Many died before you could get them to the surface.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[548]:0,129
I used greaves, protection here (gestures to his forearms) and gloves, chain-covered leather, easy to remove when not in combat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[548]:129,154
They were my own design.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[548]:154,316
We didn’t have the American battle uniforms, but we did have your marsh covers, the long, high waterproof boots with the bite-proof fiber sewn into the lining.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[548]:316,332
We needed those.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[549]:0,95
The water was high that summer; the rains were coming hard and the Seine was a raging torrent.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[549]:95,114
It was always wet.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[549]:114,177
There was rot between your fingers, your toes, in your crotch.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[549]:177,267
The water was up to your ankles almost all the time, sometimes up to your knees or waist.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[549]:267,379
You would be on point, walking, or crawling—sometimes we had to crawl in the stinking fluid up to our elbows.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[549]:379,425
And suddenly the ground would just fall away.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[549]:425,488
You would splash, headfirst, into one of those unmapped holes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[549]:488,563
You only had a few seconds to right yourself before your gas mask flooded.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[549]:563,632
You kicked and thrashed, your comrades would grab you and haul fast.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[549]:632,672
Drowning was the least of your worries.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[549]:672,823
Men would be splashing, struggling to stay afloat with all that heavy gear, and suddenly their eyes would bulge, and you’d hear their muffled cries.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[549]:823,945
You might feel the moment they attacked: the snap or tear and suddenly you fall over with the poor bastard on top of you.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[549]:945,1101
If he wasn’t wearing the marsh covers…a foot is gone, the whole leg; if he had been crawling and went in face-first…sometimes that face would be gone.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[550]:0,183
Those were times when we called a full retreat to a defensive position and waited for the Cousteaus, the scuba divers trained to work and fight specifically in those flooded tunnels.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[550]:183,288
With only a searchlight and a shark suit, if they were lucky to get one, and, at most, two hours of air.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[550]:288,365
They were supposed to wear a safety line, but most of them refused to do so.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[550]:365,433
The lines tended to get tangled and slow up the diver’s progress.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[550]:433,572
Those men, and women, had a one in twenty chance of survival, the lowest ratio of any branch of any army, I don’t care what anyone says.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[550]:572,634
1 Is it any wonder they received an automatic Legion of Honor?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:0,25
And what was it all for?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:25,59
Fifteen thousand dead or missing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:59,111
Not just the Cousteaus, all of us, the entire core.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:111,156
Fifteen thousand souls in just three months.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:156,233
Fifteen thousand at a time when the war was winding down all over the world.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:233,240
“Go!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:240,244
Go!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:244,251
Fight!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:251,294
Fight!” It didn’t have to be that way.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:294,351
How long did it take the English to clear all of London?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:351,410
Five years, three years after the war was officially over?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:410,503
They went slow and safe, one section at a time, low speed, low intensity, low casualty rate.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:503,542
Slow and safe, like most major cities.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:542,550
Why us?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[551]:550,638
That English general, what he said about “Enough dead heroes for the end of time…”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[552]:0,114
“Heroes,” that’s what we were, that’s what our leaders wanted, that’s what our people felt they needed.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[552]:114,288
After all that has happened, not just in this war, but in so many wars before: Algeria, Indochina, the Nazis…you understand what I am saying…you see the sorrow and pity?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[552]:288,407
We understood what the American president said about “reclaiming our confidence”; we understood it more than most.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[552]:407,467
We needed heroes, new names and places to restore our pride.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[553]:0,91
The Ossuary, Port-Mahon Quarry, the Hospital…that was our shining moment…the Hospital.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[553]:91,216
The Nazis had built it to house mental patients, so the legend goes, letting them starve to death behind the concrete walls.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[553]:216,281
During our war it had been an infirmary for the recently bitten.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[553]:281,460
Later, as more began to reanimate and the survivors’ humanity faded like their electric lamps, they began throwing the infected, and who knows who else, into that undead vault.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[553]:460,536
An advance team broke through without realizing what was on the other side.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[553]:536,645
They could have withdrawn, blown the tunnel, sealed them in again…One squad against three hundred zombies.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[553]:645,679
One squad led by my baby brother.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[553]:679,749
His voice was the last thing we heard before their radio went silent.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[553]:749,788
His last words: “On ne passé pas!”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[554]
DENVER, COLORADO
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[555]:0,69
[The weather is perfect for the neighborhood picnic in Victory Park.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[555]:69,176
The fact that not one sighting has been recorded this spring gives everyone even more reason to celebrate.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[555]:176,349
Todd Wainio stands in the outfield, waiting for a high fly ball that he claims “will never come.” Perhaps he’s right, as no one seems to mind me standing next to him.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[556]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[557]:0,72
They called it “the road to New York” and it was a long, long road.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[557]:72,129
We had three main Army Groups: North, Center, and South.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[557]:129,410
The grand strategy was to advance as one across the Great Plains, across the Midwest, then break off at the Appalachians, the wings sweeping north and south, shoot for Maine and Florida, then grind across the coast and link up with AG Center as they slogged it over the mountains.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[557]:410,430
It took three years.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[558]
Why so slow?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[559]:0,220
Dude, take your pick: foot transport, terrain, weather, enemies, battle doctrine…Doctrine was to advance as two solid lines, one behind the other, stretching from Canada to Aztlan…No, Mexico, it wasn’t Aztlan yet.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[559]:220,330
You know when a plane goes down, how all these firemen or whoever would check a field for pieces of wreckage?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[559]:330,415
They’d all go in a line, real slow, making sure not one inch of ground was missed.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[559]:415,428
That was us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[559]:428,497
We didn’t skip one damn inch between the Rockies and the Atlantic.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[559]:497,586
Whenever you spotted Zack, either in a group or just on his own, a FAR unit would halt…
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[560]
FAR?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[561]:0,28
Force Appropriate Response.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[561]:28,101
You couldn’t stop, like, the whole Army Group, for one or two zombies.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[561]:101,290
A lot of the older Gs, the ones infected early in the war, they were starting to get pretty grody, all deflated, parts of their skulls starting to show, some bone poking through the flesh.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[561]:290,386
Some of them couldn’t even stand anymore, and those are the ones you really had to watch for.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[561]:386,475
They’d be crawling on their bellies toward you, or just thrashing facedown in the mud.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[561]:475,631
You’d halt a section, a platoon, maybe even a company depending on how many you encountered, just enough to take ’em down and sanitize the battlefield.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[561]:631,764
The hole your FAR unit left in the battle line was replaced by an equal force from the secondary line a click and a half behind you.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[561]:764,801
That way the front was never broken.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[561]:801,857
We leapfrogged this way all the way across the country.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[561]:857,905
It worked, no doubt, but man, it took its time.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[561]:905,935
Night also put the brakes on.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[561]:935,1063
Once the sun dipped, no matter how confident you felt or how safe the area seemed, the show was over till dawn the next morning.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[562]:0,19
And there was fog.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[562]:19,74
I didn’t know fog could be so thick that far inland.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[562]:74,136
I always wanted to ask a climatologist or someone about that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[562]:136,191
The whole front might get slammed, sometimes for days.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[562]:191,384
Just sitting there in zero visibility, occasionally one of your Ks would start barking or a man down the line would shout “Contact!” You’d hear the moan and then the shapes would appear.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[562]:384,438
Hard enough just standing still and waiting for them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[562]:438,555
I saw a movie once, 1 this BBC documentary about how because the UK was so foggy, the British army would never stop.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[562]:555,681
There was a scene, where the cameras caught a real firefight, just sparks from their weapons and hazy silhouettes going down.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[562]:681,730
They didn’t need that extra creepy soundtrack.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[562]:730,764
2 It freaked me out just to watch.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[563]:0,96
It also slowed us down to have to keep pace with the other countries, the Mexicans and Canucks.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[563]:96,160
Neither army had the manpower to liberate their entire country.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[563]:160,243
The deal was that they’d keep our borders clear while we get our house in order.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[563]:243,257
Once the U.S.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[563]:257,308
was secure, we’d give them everything they need.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[563]:308,403
That was the start of the UN multinational force, but I was discharged long before those days.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[563]:403,506
For me, it always felt like hurry up and wait, creeping along through rough terrain or built-up areas.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[563]:506,565
Oh, and you wanna talk about speed bumps, try urban combat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[564]:0,53
The strategy was always to surround the target area.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[564]:53,246
We’d set up semipermanent defenses, recon with everything from satellites to sniffer Ks, do whatever we could to call Zack out, and go in only after we were sure no more of them were coming.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[564]:246,282
Smart and safe and relatively easy.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[564]:282,294
Yeah, right!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[565]:0,93
As far as surrounding the “area,” someone wanna tell me where that area actually begins?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[565]:93,182
Cities weren’t cities anymore, you know, they just grew out into this suburban sprawl.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[565]:182,367
Mrs. Ruiz, one of our medics, called it “in-fill.” She was in real estate before the war and explained that the hottest properties were always the land between two existing cities.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[565]:367,427
Freakin’ “in-fill,” we all learned to hate that term.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[565]:427,550
For us, it meant clearing block after block of burbland before we could even think of establishing a quarantine perimeter.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[565]:550,632
Fast-food joints, shopping centers, endless miles of cheap, cookie-cutter housing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[566]:0,65
Even in winter, it’s not like everything was safe and snuggly.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[566]:65,92
I was in Army Group North.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[566]:92,137
At first I thought we were golden, you know.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[566]:137,260
Six months out of the year, I wouldn’t have to see a live G, eight months actually, given what wartime weather was like.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[566]:260,425
I thought, hey, once the temp drops, we’re little more than garbage men: find ’em, Lobo ’em, mark ’em for burial once the ground begins to thaw, no problem.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[566]:425,504
But I should be Lobo’d for thinking that Zack was the only bad guy out there.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[567]:0,60
We had quislings, just like the real thing, but winterized.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[567]:60,141
We had these Human Reclamation units, pretty much just glorified animal control.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[567]:141,304
They’d do their best to dart any quislings we came across, tie ’em down, ship ’em to rehabilitation clinics, back when we thought we could rehabilitate them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[568]:0,42
Ferals were a much more dangerous threat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[568]:42,118
A lot of them weren’t kids anymore, some were teenagers, some full grown.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[568]:118,220
They were fast, smart, and if they chose fight instead of flight, they could really mess up your day.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[568]:220,309
Of course, HR would always try and dart them, and, of course, that didn’t always work.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[568]:309,447
When a two-hundred-pound feral bull is charging balls out for your ass, a couple CCs of tranq ain’t gonna drop him before he hits home.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[568]:447,524
A lot of HRs got pretty badly smashed up, a few had to be tagged and bagged.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[568]:524,590
The brass had to step in and assign a squad of grunts for escort.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[568]:590,644
If a dart didn’t stop a feral, we sure as hell did.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[568]:644,716
Nothing screams as high as a feral with a PIE round burning in his gut.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[568]:716,759
The HR pukes had a real problem with that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[568]:759,874
They were all volunteers, all sticking to this code that human life, any human’s life, was worth trying to save.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[568]:874,1028
I guess history sorta backed them up now, you know, seeing all those people that they managed to rehabilitate, all the ones we just woulda shot on sight.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[568]:1028,1112
If they had had the resources, they might have been able to do the same for animals.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[569]:0,63
Man, feral packs, that freaked me out more than anything else.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[569]:63,92
I’m not just talking dogs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[569]:92,124
Dogs you knew how to deal with.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[569]:124,163
Dogs always telegraphed their attacks.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[569]:163,257
I’m talking “Flies” 3 : F-Lions, cats, like part mountain lion, part ice age saberfuck.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[569]:257,400
Maybe they were mountain lions, some sure looked like them, or maybe just the spawn of house cats that had to be super badass just to make it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[569]:400,478
I’ve heard that they grew bigger up north, some law of nature or evolution.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[569]:478,562
4 I don’t really get the whole ecology thing, not past a few prewar nature shows.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[569]:562,726
I hear it’s because rats were, like, the new cows; fast and smart enough to get away from Zack, livin’ on corpses, breeding by the millions in trees and ruins.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[569]:726,836
They’d gotten pretty badass themselves, so anything tough enough to hunt them has to be a whole lot badder.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[569]:836,962
That’s an F-lion for you, about twice the size of a prewar puffball, teeth, claws, and a real, real jonesing for warm blood.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[570]
That must have been a hazard for the sniffer dogs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[571]:0,17
Are you kidding?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[571]:17,92
They loved it, even the little dachmutts, made ’em feel like dogs again.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[571]:92,160
I’m talking about us, getting jumped from a tree limb, or a roof.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[571]:160,283
They didn’t charge you like F-hounds, they just waited, took their sweet time until you were too close to raise a weapon.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[572]:0,60
Outside of Minneapolis, my squad was clearing a strip mall.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[572]:60,172
I was stepping through the window of a Starbucks and suddenly three of them leap at me from behind the counter.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[572]:172,227
They knock me over, start tearing at my arms, my face.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[572]:227,255
How do you think I got this?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[573]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[574]
[He refers to the scar on his cheek.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[575]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[576]:0,55
I guess the only real casualty that day was my shorts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[576]:55,258
Between the bite-proof BDUs and body armor we’d started wearing, the vest, the helmet…I hadn’t worn a hard cover in so long, you forget how uncomfortable it is when you’re used to going soft top.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[577]
Did ferals, feral people that is, know how to use firearms?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[578]:0,76
They didn’t know how to do anything human, that’s why they were ferals.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[578]:76,159
No, the body armor was for protection against some of the regular people we found.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[578]:159,236
I’m not talking organized rebels, just the odd LaMOE, 5 Last Man on Earth.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[578]:236,324
There was always one or two in every town, some dude, or chick, who managed to survive.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[578]:324,466
I read somewhere that the United States had the highest number of them in the world, something about our individualistic nature or something.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[578]:466,570
They hadn’t seen real people in so long, a lot of the initial shooting was just accidental or reflex.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[578]:570,617
Most of the time we managed to talk them down.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[578]:617,718
Those we actually called RCs, Robinson Crusoes—that was the polite term for the ones who were cool.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[579]:0,89
The ones we called LaMOEs, those were the ones who were a little too used to being king.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[579]:89,254
King of what, I don’t know, Gs and quislings and crazy F-critters, but I guess in their mind they were living the good life, and here we were to take it all away.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[579]:254,280
That’s how I got nailed.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[580]:0,47
We were closing on the Sears Tower in Chicago.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[580]:47,104
Chicago, that was enough nightmares for three lifetimes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[580]:104,250
It was the middle of winter, wind whipping off the lake so hard you could barely stand, and suddenly I felt Thor’s hammer smash me in the head.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[580]:250,290
Slug from a high-powered hunting rifle.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[580]:290,351
I never complained about our hard covers anymore after that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[580]:351,449
The gang in the tower, they had their little kingdom, and they weren’t giving it up for anyone.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[580]:449,567
That was one of the few times we went full convent; SAWs, nades, that’s when the Bradleys started making a comeback.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[581]:0,78
After Chicago, the brass knew we were now in a full, multithreat environment.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[581]:78,137
It was back to hard covers and body armor, even in summer.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[581]:137,157
Thanks, Windy City.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[581]:157,219
Each squad was issued pamphlets with the “Threat Pyramid.”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[582]:0,55
It was ranked according to probability, not lethality.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[582]:55,131
Zack at the bottom, then F-critters, ferals, quislings, and finally LaMOEs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[582]:131,298
I know a lot of guys from AG South like to bitch about how they always had it tougher on their end, ’cause, for us, winter took care of Zack’s whole threat level.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[582]:298,351
Yeah, sure, and replaced it with another one: winter!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[583]:0,90
What do they say the average temperature’s dropped, ten degrees, fifteen in some areas?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[583]:90,259
6 Yeah, we had it real easy, up to our ass in gray snow, knowing that for every five Zacksicles you cracked there’d be at least as many up and at ’em at first thaw.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[583]:259,340
At least the guys down south knew that once they swept an area, it stayed swept.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[583]:340,401
They didn’t have to worry about rear area attacks like us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[583]:401,443
We swept every area at least three times.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[583]:443,517
We used everything from ramrods and sniffer Ks to high-tech ground radar.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[583]:517,577
Over and over again, and all of this in the dead of winter.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[583]:577,631
We lost more guys to frostbite than to anything else.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[583]:631,891
And still, every spring, you knew, you just knew…it’d be like, “oh shit, here we go again.” I mean, even today, with all the sweeps and civilian volunteer groups, spring’s like winter used to be, nature letting us know the good life’s over for now.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[584]
Tell me about liberating the isolated zones.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[585]:0,39
Always a hard fight, every single one.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[585]:39,116
Remember these zones were still under siege, hundreds, maybe even thousands.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[585]:116,284
The people holed up in the twin forts of Comerica Park/Ford Field, they must have had a combined moat—that’s what we called them, moats—of at least a million Gs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[585]:284,353
That was a three-day slugfest, made Hope look like a minor skirmish.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[585]:353,424
That was the only time I ever really thought we were gonna be overrun.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[585]:424,512
They piled up so high I thought we’d be buried, literally, in a landslide of corpses.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[585]:512,588
Battles like that, they’d leave you so fried, just wasted, body and mind.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[585]:588,656
You’d want to sleep, nothing more, not eat or bathe or even fuck.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[585]:656,741
You’d just want to find someplace warm and dry, close your eyes, forget everything.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[586]
What were the reactions of the people who you liberated?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[587]:0,15
Kind of a mix.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[587]:15,60
The military zones, that was pretty low-key.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[587]:60,180
A lot of formal ceremonies, raising and lowering of flags, “I relieve you, sir—I stand relieved,” shit like that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[587]:180,227
There was also a little bit of wienie wagging.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[587]:227,281
You know “we didn’t need any rescuing” and all.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[587]:281,295
I understand.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[587]:295,389
Every grunt wants to be the one riding over the hill, no one likes to be the one in the fort.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[587]:389,428
Sure you didn’t need rescuing, buddy.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[588]:0,23
Sometimes it was true.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[588]:23,58
Like the zoomies outside of Omaha.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[588]:58,134
They were a strategic hub for airdrops, regular flights almost on the hour.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[588]:134,212
They were actually living better than us, fresh chow, hot showers, soft beds.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[588]:212,255
It almost felt like we were being rescued.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[588]:255,311
On the other hand, you had the jarheads at Rock Island.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[588]:311,384
They wouldn’t let on how rough they had it, and that was cool with us.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[588]:384,462
For what they went through, bragging rights was the least we could give them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[588]:462,525
Never met any of them personally, but I’ve heard the stories.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[589]
What about the civilian zones?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[590]:0,26
Different story entirely.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[590]:26,47
We were so the shit!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[590]:47,82
They’d be cheering and shouting.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[590]:82,204
It was like what you’d think war was supposed to be, those old black-and-whites of GIs marching into Paris or wherever.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[590]:204,224
We were rock stars.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[590]:224,351
I got more…well…if there’s a bunch of little dudes between here and the Hero City that happen to look like me…[Laughs.]
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[591]
But there were exceptions.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[592]:0,15
Yeah, I guess.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[592]:15,124
Maybe not all the time but there’d be this one person, this angry face in the crowd screaming shit at you.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[592]:124,354
“What the fuck took you so long?” “My husband died two weeks ago!” “My mother died waiting for you!” “We lost half our people last summer!” “Where were you when we needed you?” People holding up photos, faces.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[592]:354,469
When we marched into Janesville, Wisconsin, someone was holding up a sign with a picture of a smiling little girl.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[592]:469,592
The words above it read “Better late than never?” He got beat down by his own people; they shouldn’t have done that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[592]:592,692
That’s the kind of shit we saw, shit that keeps you awake when you haven’t slept in five nights.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[593]:0,87
Rarely, like, blue-moon rarely, we’d enter a zone where we were totally not welcome.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[593]:87,152
In Valley City, North Dakota, they were like, “Fuck you, army!
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[593]:152,194
You ran out on us, we don’t need you!”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[594]
Was that a secessionist zone?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[595]:0,40
Oh no, at least these people let us in.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[595]:40,82
The Rebs only welcomed you with gunshots.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[595]:82,123
I never got close to any of those zones.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[595]:123,161
The brass had special units for Rebs.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[595]:161,222
I saw them on the road once, heading toward the Black Hills.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[595]:222,296
That was the first time since crossing the Rockies that I ever saw tanks.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[595]:296,341
Bad feeling; you knew how that was gonna end.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[596]
There’s been a lot of stories about questionable survival methods used by certain isolated zones.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[597]:0,10
Yeah, so?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[597]:10,28
Ask them about it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[598]
Did you see any?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[599]:0,30
Nope, and I didn’t want to.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[599]:30,85
People tried to tell me about it, people we liberated.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[599]:85,160
They were so wound up inside, they just wanted to get it off their chests.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[599]:160,297
You know what I used to say to them, “Keep it on your chest, your war’s over.” I didn’t need any more rocks in my ruck, you know?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[600]:0,22
What about afterward?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[600]:22,58
Did you talk to any of those people?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[601]
Yeah, and I read a lot about the trials.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[602]
How did they make you feel?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[603]:0,22
Shit, I don’t know.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[603]:22,54
Who am I to judge those people?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[603]:54,107
I wasn’t there, I didn’t have to deal with that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[603]:107,218
This conversation we’re having now, this question of “what if,” I didn’t have time for that back then.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[603]:218,242
I still had a job to do.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[604]:0,50
I know historians like to talk about how the U.S.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[604]:50,104
Army had such a low casualty rate during the advance.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[604]:104,173
Low, as in compared to other countries, China or maybe the Russkies.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[604]:173,229
Low, as in only counting the casualties caused by Zack.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[604]:229,324
There were a million ways to get it on that road and over two-thirds weren’t on that pyramid.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[605]:0,114
Sickness was a big one, the kinds of diseases that were supposed to be gone, like, in the Dark Ages or something.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[605]:114,296
Yeah, we took our pills, had our shots, ate well, and had regular checkups, but there was just so much shit everywhere, in the dirt, the water, in the rain, and the air we breathed.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[605]:296,420
Every time we entered a city, or liberated a zone, at least one guy would be gone, if not dead then removed for quarantine.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[605]:420,472
In Detroit, we lost a whole platoon to Spanish flu.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[605]:472,556
The brass really freaked on that one, quarantined the whole battalion for two weeks.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[606]:0,88
Then there were mines and booby traps, some civilian, some laid during our bugout west.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[606]:88,119
Made a lot of sense back then.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[606]:119,183
Just seed mile after mile and wait for Zack to blow himself up.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[606]:183,229
Only problem is, mines don’t work that way.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[606]:229,315
They don’t blow up a human body, they take off a leg or ankle or the family jewels.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[606]:315,616
That’s what they’re designed for, not to kill people, but to wound ’em so the army will spend valuable resources keeping them alive, and then send ’em home in a wheelchair so Ma and Pa Civilian can be reminded every time they see ’em that maybe supporting this war isn’t such a good idea.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[606]:616,661
But Zack has no home, no Ma and Pa Civilian.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[606]:661,911
All conventional mines do is create a bunch of crippled ghouls that, if anything, just makes your job that much harder because you want them upright and easy to spot, not crawling around the weeds waiting to be stepped on like land mines themselves.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[606]:911,1114
You couldn’t know where most mines were; a lot of the units that set them during the retreat hadn’t marked them correctly or had lost their coordinates or simply weren’t alive anymore to tell you.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[606]:1114,1217
And then you had all those stupid fuckin’ LaMOE jobs, the punji stakes and trip-wired shotgun shells.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[607]:0,71
I lost a buddy of mine that way, in a Wal-Mart in Rochester, New York.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[607]:71,119
He was born in El Salvador but grew up in Cali.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[607]:119,161
You ever heard of the Boyle Heights Boyz?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[607]:161,275
They were these hard-core LA bangers who were deported back to El Salvador because they were technically illegal.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[607]:275,324
My buddy was plopped there right before the war.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[607]:324,446
He fought his way back up through Mexico, all during the worst days of the Panic, all on foot with nothing but a machete.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[607]:446,515
He didn’t have any family left, no friends, just his adopted home.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[607]:515,546
He loved this country so much.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[607]:546,610
Reminded me of my grandpa, you know, the whole immigrant thing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[607]:610,720
And then to catch a twelve-gauge in the face, probably set by a LaMOE who’d stopped breathing years before.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[607]:720,752
Fuckin’ mines and booby traps.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[608]:0,33
And then you just had accidents.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[608]:33,88
So many buildings had been weakened from the fighting.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[608]:88,144
Throw in years of neglect, and foot after foot of snow.

====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[608]:216,247
I lost someone else like that.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[608]:247,322
She had a contact, a feral running at her across an abandoned auto garage.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[608]:322,366
She fired her weapon, that’s all it took.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[608]:366,437
I don’t know how many pounds of snow and ice brought that roof down.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[608]:437,474
She was…we were…close, you know.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[608]:474,506
We never did anything about it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[608]:506,643
I guess we thought that would make it “official.” I guess we thought it would make it easier in case something happened to one of us.

And then there were psych casualties.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[616]:38,72
More than anything else combined.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[616]:72,160
Sometimes we’d march into barricaded zones and find nothing but rat-gnawed skeletons.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[616]:160,314
I’m talking about the zones that weren’t overrun, the ones that fell to starvation or disease, or just a feeling that tomorrow wasn’t worth seeing.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[616]:314,409
We once broke into a church in Kansas where it was clear the adults killed all the kids first.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[616]:409,688
One guy in our platoon, an Amish guy, used to read all their suicide notes, commit them to memory, then give himself this little cut, this tiny half-inch nick somewhere on his body so he would “never forget.” Crazy bastard was sliced from his neck to the bottom of his toes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[616]:688,762
When the LT found out about it…sectioned eight his ass right outa there.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[617]:0,47
Most of the Eight Balls were later in the war.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[617]:47,117
Not from the stress, though, you understand, but from the lack of it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[617]:117,318
We all knew it would be over soon, and I think a lot of people who’d been holding it together for so long must’ve had that little voice that said, “Hey, buddy, it’s cool now, you can let go.”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[618]:0,97
I knew this one guy, massive ’roidasaurus, he’d been a professional wrestler before the war.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[618]:97,211
We were walking up the freeway near Pulaski, New York, when the wind picked up the scent of a jackknifed big rig.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[618]:211,300
It’d been loaded with bottles of perfume, nothing fancy, just cheap, strip mall scent.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[618]:300,343
He froze and started bawlin’ like a kid.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[618]:343,360
Couldn’t stop.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[618]:360,488
He was a monster with a two grand body count, an ogre who’d once picked up a G and used it as a club for hand-to-hand combat.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[618]:488,536
Four of us had to carry him out on a stretcher.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[618]:536,594
We figured the perfume must have reminded him of someone.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[618]:594,617
We never found out who.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[619]:0,181
Another guy, nothing special about him, late forties, balding, bit of a paunch, as much as anyone could have back then, the kinda face you’d see in a prewar heartburn commercial.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[619]:181,254
We were in Hammond, Indiana, scouting defenses for the siege of Chicago.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[619]:254,381
He spied a house at the end of a deserted street, completely intact except for boarded-up windows and a crashed-in front door.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[619]:381,416
He got a look on his face, a grin.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[619]:416,503
We should have known way before he dropped out of formation, before we heard the shot.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[619]:503,621
He was sitting in the living room, in this worn, old easy chair, SIR between his knees, that smile still on his face.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[619]:621,669
I looked up at the pictures on the mantelpiece.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[619]:669,685
It was his home.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[620]:0,66
Those were extreme examples, ones that even I could have guessed.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[620]:66,108
A lot of the others, you just never knew.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[620]:108,172
For me, it wasn’t just who was cracking up, but who wasn’t.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[620]:172,193
Does that make sense?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[621]:0,130
One night in Portland, Maine, we were in Deering Oaks Park, policing piles of bleached bones that had been there since the Panic.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[621]:130,239
Two grunts pick up these skulls and start doing a skit, the one from Free to Be, You and Me, the two babies.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[621]:239,331
I only recognized it because my big brother had the record, it was a little before my time.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[621]:331,382
Some of the older Grunts, the Xers, they loved it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[621]:382,467
A little crowd started gathering, everyone laughing and howling at these two skulls.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[621]:467,677
“Hi-Hi-I’m a baby.—Well what do you think I am, a loaf’a bread?” And when it was over, everyone spontaneously burst into song, “There’s a land that I see…” playing femurs like goddamn banjos.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[621]:677,734
I looked across the crowd to one of our company shrinks.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[621]:734,799
I could never pronounce his real name, Doctor Chandra-something.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[621]:799,988
7 I made eye contact and gave him this look, like “Hey, Doc, they’re all nut jobs, right?” He must have known what my eyes were asking because he just smiled back and shook his head.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[621]:988,1110
That really spooked me; I mean, if the ones who were acting loopy weren’t, then how did you know who’d really lost it?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[622]:0,50
Our squad leader, you’d probably recognize her.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[622]:50,94
She was in The Battle of the Five Colleges.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[622]:94,180
Remember the tall, amazon chick with the ditch blade, the one who’d sung that song?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[622]:180,229
She didn’t look like she used to in the movie.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[622]:229,323
She’d burned off her curves and a crew cut replaced all that long, thick, shiny black hair.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[622]:323,413
She was a good squad leader, “Sergeant Avalon.” One day we found a turtle in a field.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[622]:413,480
Turtles were like unicorns back then, you hardly saw them anymore.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[622]:480,530
Avalon got this look, I don’t know, like a kid.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[622]:530,542
She smiled.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[622]:542,560
She never smiled.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[622]:560,762
I heard her whisper something to the turtle, I thought it was gibberish: “Mitakuye Oyasin.” I found out later that it was Lakota for “all my relations.” I didn’t even know she was part Sioux.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[622]:762,815
She never talked about it, about anything about her.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[622]:815,1007
And suddenly, like a ghost, there was Doctor Chandra, with that arm he always put around their shoulders and that soft, no-big-deal offer of “C’mon, Sarge, let’s grab a cup of coffee.”
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[623]:0,42
That was the same day the president died.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[623]:42,85
He must have also heard that little voice.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[623]:85,237
“Hey, buddy, it’s cool now, you can let go.” I know a lot of people weren’t so into the VP, like there was no way he could replace the Big Guy.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[623]:237,308
I really felt for him, mainly ’cause I was now in the same position.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[623]:308,345
With Avalon gone, I was squad leader.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[624]:0,49
It didn’t matter that the war was almost over.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[624]:49,137
There were still so many battles along the way, so many good people to say good-bye to.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[624]:137,211
By the time we reached Yonkers, I was the last of the old gang from Hope.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[624]:211,336
I don’t know how I felt, passing all that rusting wreckage: the abandoned tanks, the crushed news vans, the human remains.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[624]:336,377
I don’t think I felt much of anything.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[624]:377,456
Too much to do when you’re squad leader, too many new faces to take care of.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[624]:456,509
I could feel Doctor Chandra’s eyes boring into me.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[624]:509,580
He never came over though, never let on that there was anything wrong.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[624]:580,660
When we boarded the barges on the banks of the Hudson, we managed to lock eyes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[624]:660,695
He just smiled and shook his head.

Man was a loser, a third-rate mediocrity who only slipped into the history books because he unseated Winston Churchill before World War II officially ended.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[630]:222,468
The war in Europe was over, and to the British people, there was this feeling that they’d suffered enough, but Churchill kept pushing to help the United States against Japan, saying the fight wasn’t finished until it was finished everywhere.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[630]:468,508
And look what happened to the Old Lion.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[630]:508,572
That’s what we didn’t want to happen to our administration.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[630]:572,649

had been secured.

Everyone knew the war wasn’t really over.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[631]:44,153
We still had to help out our allies and clear whole parts of the world that were entirely ruled by the dead.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[631]:153,272
There was still so much work to do, but since our own house was in order, we had to give people the option to go home.

/html/body/div/div[15]/p[631]:272,408
That’s when the UN multinational force was created, and we were pleasantly surprised how many volunteers signed up in the first week.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[631]:408,561
We actually had to turn some of them away, put them on the reserve list or assign them to train all the young bucks who missed the drive across America.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[631]:561,709
I know I caught a lot of flak for going UN instead of making it an all-American crusade, and to be totally honest, I really couldn’t give a damn.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[631]:709,932
America’s a fair country, her people expect a fair deal, and when that deal ends with the last boots on Atlantic beaches, you shake their hands, pay them off, and let anyone who wants to reclaim their private lives do so.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[632]:0,58
Maybe it’s made the overseas campaigns a little slower.

“Just try it, you old yekke,” they’d say.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[731]:243,351
That’s what they called me, a “yekke.” It means tight ass, but the official definition is German Jew.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[731]:351,382
They were right on both counts.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[732]:0,91
I was in the “Kindertransport,” the last chance to get Jewish children out of Germany.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[732]:91,144
That was the last time I saw any of my family alive.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[732]:144,231
There’s a little pond, in a small town in Poland, where they used to dump the ashes.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[732]:231,281
The pond is still gray, even half a century later.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[733]:0,234
I’ve heard it said that the Holocaust has no survivors, that even those who managed to remain technically alive were so irreparably damaged, that their spirit, their soul, the person that they were supposed to be, was gone forever.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[733]:234,273
I’d like to think that’s not true.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[733]:273,326
But if it is, then no one on Earth survived this war.

====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[737]:0,37
You wanna know who lost World War Z?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[737]:37,45
Whales.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[737]:45,196
I guess they never really had much of a chance, not with several million hungry boat people and half the world’s navies converted to fishing fleets.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[737]:196,338
It doesn’t take much, just one helo-dropped torp, not so close as to do any physical damage, but close enough to leave them deaf and dazed.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[737]:338,402
They wouldn’t notice the factory ships until it was too late.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[737]:402,474
You could hear it for miles away, the warhead detonations, the shrieks.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[737]:474,515
Nothing conducts sound energy like water.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:0,97
Hell of a loss, and you don’t have to be some patchouli stinking crunch-head to appreciate it.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:97,208
My dad worked at Scripps, not the Claremont girl’s school, the oceanographic institute outside of San Diego.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:208,301
That’s why I joined the navy in the first place and how I first learned to love the ocean.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:301,347
You couldn’t help but see California grays.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:347,442
Majestic animals, they were finally making a comeback after almost being hunted to extinction.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:442,541
They’d stopped being afraid of us and sometimes you could paddle out close enough to touch them.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:541,663
They could have killed us in a heartbeat, one smack of a twelve-foot tail fluke, one lunge of a thirtysomething-ton body.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:663,765
Early whalers used to call them devilfish because of the fierce fights they’d put up when cornered.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:765,815
They knew we didn’t mean them any harm, though.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:815,926
They’d even let us pet them, or, maybe if they were feeling protective of a calf, just brush us gently away.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:926,976
So much power, so much potential for destruction.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:976,1108
Amazing creatures, the California grays, and now they’re all gone, along with the blues, and finbacks, and humpbacks, and rights.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:1108,1271
I’ve heard of random sightings of a few belugas and narwhals that survived under the Arctic ice, but there probably aren’t enough for a sustainable gene pool.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:1271,1460
I know there are still a few intact pods of orcas, but with pollution levels the way they are, and less fish than an Arizona swimming pool, I wouldn’t be too optimistic about their odds.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:1460,1615
Even if Mama Nature does give those killers some kind of reprieve, adapt them like she did with some of the dinosaurs, the gentle giants are gone forever.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:1615,1721
Kinda like that movie Oh God where the All Mighty challenges Man to try and make a mackerel from scratch.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[738]:1721,1860
“You can’t,” he says, and unless some genetic archivist got in there ahead of the torpedoes, you also can’t make a California gray.

So the next time someone tries to tell you about how the true losses of this war are “our innocence” or “part of our humanity”…

====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[749]
 
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[750]:0,61
Yeah, I lose it sometimes, for a few minutes, maybe an hour.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[750]:61,104
Doctor Chandra told me it was cool though.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[750]:104,138
He counsels right here at the VA.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[750]:138,250
He told me once that it’s a totally healthy thing, like little earthquakes releasing pressure off of a fault.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[750]:250,341
He says anyone who’s not having these “minor tremors” you really gotta watch out for.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[751]:0,38
It doesn’t take much to set me off.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[751]:38,122
Sometimes I’ll smell something, or somebody’s voice will sound really familiar.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[751]:122,252
Last month at dinner, the radio was playing this song, I don’t think it was about my war, I don’t even think it was American.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[751]:252,361
The accent and some of the terms were all different, but the chorus…“God help me, I was only nineteen.”

Funny thing is, my most vivid memory kinda got turned into the national icon of the victory.

That was us, standing on the Jersey riverbank, watching the dawn over New York.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[759]:80,121
We’d just got the word, it was VA Day.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[759]:121,160
There was no cheering, no celebration.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[759]:160,188
It just didn’t seem real.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[759]:188,195
Peace?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[759]:195,224
What the hell did that mean?
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[759]:224,364
I’d been afraid for so long, fighting and killing, and waiting to die, that I guess I just accepted it as normal for the rest of my life.
====
/html/body/div/div[15]/p[759]:364,479
I thought it was a dream, sometimes it still feels like one, remembering that day, that sunrise over the Hero City.
