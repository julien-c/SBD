<p>Radio was also born of piracy.</p>
<p>When a radio station plays a record on the air, that constitutes
a "public performance" of the composer's work.<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_62" id="footnote_62_call">[62]</a> As
I described above, the law gives the composer (or copyright holder)
an exclusive right to public performances of his work. The radio
station thus owes the composer money for that performance.</p>
<p>But when the radio station plays a record, it is not only
performing a copy of the composer's work. The radio station is also
performing a copy of the recording artist's work. It's one thing to
have "Happy Birthday" sung on the radio by the local children's
choir; it's quite another to have it sung by the Rolling Stones or
Lyle Lovett. The recording artist is adding to the value of the
composition performed on the radio station. And if the law were
perfectly consistent, the radio station would have to pay the
recording artist for his work, just as it pays the composer of the
music for his work.</p>
<p>But it doesn't. Under the law governing radio performances, the
radio station does not have to pay the recording artist. The radio
station need only pay the composer. The radio station thus gets a
bit of something for nothing. It gets to perform the recording
artist's work for free, even if it must pay the composer something
for the privilege of playing the song.</p>
<p>This difference can be huge. Imagine you compose a piece of
music. Imagine it is your first. You own the exclusive right to
authorize public performances of that music. So if Madonna wants to
sing your song in public, she has to get your permission.</p>
<p>Imagine she does sing your song, and imagine she likes it a lot.
She then decides to make a recording of your song, and it becomes a
top hit. Under our law, every time a radio station plays your song,
you get some money. But Madonna gets nothing, save the indirect
effect on the sale of her CDs. The public performance of her
recording is not a "protected" right. The radio station thus gets
to pirate the value of Madonna's work without paying her
anything.</p>
<p>No doubt, one might argue that, on balance, the recording
artists benefit. On average, the promotion they get is worth more
than the performance rights they give up. Maybe. But even if so,
the law ordinarily gives the creator the right to make this choice.
By making the choice for him or her, the law gives the radio
station the right to take something for nothing.</p>
