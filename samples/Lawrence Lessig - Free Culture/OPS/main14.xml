<h3 class="section_title">1. Piracy I</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>All across the world, but especially in Asia and Eastern Europe,
there are businesses that do nothing but take others people's
copyrighted content, copy it, and sell it—all without the
permission of a copyright owner. The recording industry estimates
that it loses about $4.6 billion every year to physical
piracy<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_70" id=
"footnote_70_call">[70]</a> (that works out to one in three CDs
sold worldwide). The MPAA estimates that it loses $3 billion
annually worldwide to piracy.</p>
<p>This is piracy plain and simple. Nothing in the argument of this
book, nor in the argument that most people make when talking about
the subject of this book, should draw into doubt this simple point:
This piracy is wrong.</p>
<p>Which is not to say that excuses and justifications couldn't be
made for it. We could, for example, remind ourselves that for the
first one hundred years of the American Republic, America did not
honor foreign copyrights. We were born, in this sense, a pirate
nation. It might therefore seem hypocritical for us to insist so
strongly that other developing nations treat as wrong what we, for
the first hundred years of our existence, treated as right.</p>
<p>That excuse isn't terribly strong. Technically, our law did not
ban the taking of foreign works. It explicitly limited itself to
American works. Thus the American publishers who published foreign
works without the permission of foreign authors were not violating
any rule. The copy shops in Asia, by contrast, are violating Asian
law. Asian law does protect foreign copyrights, and the actions of
the copy shops violate that law. So the wrong of piracy that they
engage in is not just a moral wrong, but a legal wrong, and not
just an internationally legal wrong, but a locally legal wrong as
well.</p>
<p>True, these local rules have, in effect, been imposed upon these
countries. No country can be part of the world economy and choose
not to protect copyright internationally. We may have been born a
pirate nation, but we will not allow any other nation to have a
similar childhood.</p>
<p>If a country is to be treated as a sovereign, however, then its
laws are its laws regardless of their source. The international law
under which these nations live gives them some opportunities to
escape the burden of intellectual property law.<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_71" id="footnote_71_call">[71]</a> In
my view, more developing nations should take advantage of that
opportunity, but when they don't, then their laws should be
respected. And under the laws of these nations, this piracy is
wrong.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could try to excuse this piracy by noting that
in any case, it does no harm to the industry. The Chinese who get
access to American CDs at 50 cents a copy are not people who would
have bought those American CDs at $15 a copy. So no one really has
any less money than they otherwise would have had.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_72" id=
"footnote_72_call">[72]</a></p>
<p>This is often true (though I have friends who have purchased
many thousands of pirated DVDs who certainly have enough money to
pay for the content they have taken), and it does mitigate to some
degree the harm caused by such taking. Extremists in this debate
love to say, "You wouldn't go into Barnes &amp; Noble and take a
book off of the shelf without paying; why should it be any
different with on-line music?" The difference is, of course, that
when you take a book from Barnes &amp; Noble, it has one less book
to sell. By contrast, when you take an MP3 from a computer network,
there is not one less CD that can be sold. The physics of piracy of
the intangible are different from the physics of piracy of the
tangible.</p>
<p>This argument is still very weak. However, although copyright is
a property right of a very special sort, it is a property right.
Like all property rights, the copyright gives the owner the right
to decide the terms under which content is shared. If the copyright
owner doesn't want to sell, she doesn't have to. There are
exceptions: important statutory licenses that apply to copyrighted
content regardless of the wish of the copyright owner. Those
licenses give people the right to "take" copyrighted content
whether or not the copyright owner wants to sell. But where the law
does not give people the right to take content, it is wrong to take
that content even if the wrong does no harm. If we have a property
system, and that system is properly balanced to the technology of a
time, then it is wrong to take property without the permission of a
property owner. That is exactly what "property" means.</p>
<p>Finally, we could try to excuse this piracy with the argument
that the piracy actually helps the copyright owner. When the
Chinese "steal" Windows, that makes the Chinese dependent on
Microsoft. Microsoft loses the value of the software that was
taken. But it gains users who are used to life in the Microsoft
world. Over time, as the nation grows more wealthy, more and more
people will buy software rather than steal it. And hence over time,
because that buying will benefit Microsoft, Microsoft benefits from
the piracy. If instead of pirating Microsoft Windows, the Chinese
used the free GNU/Linux operating system, then these Chinese users
would not eventually be buying Microsoft. Without piracy, then,
Microsoft would lose.</p>
<p>This argument, too, is somewhat true. The addiction strategy is
a good one. Many businesses practice it. Some thrive because of it.
Law students, for example, are given free access to the two largest
legal databases. The companies marketing both hope the students
will become so used to their service that they will want to use it
and not the other when they become lawyers (and must pay high
subscription fees).</p>
<p>Still, the argument is not terribly persuasive. We don't give
the alcoholic a defense when he steals his first beer, merely
because that will make it more likely that he will buy the next
three. Instead, we ordinarily allow businesses to decide for
themselves when it is best to give their product away. If Microsoft
fears the competition of GNU/Linux, then Microsoft can give its
product away, as it did, for example, with Internet Explorer to
fight Netscape. A property right means giving the property owner
the right to say who gets access to what—at least ordinarily. And
if the law properly balances the rights of the copyright owner with
the rights of access, then violating the law is still wrong.</p>
<p>Thus, while I understand the pull of these justifications for
piracy, and I certainly see the motivation, in my view, in the end,
these efforts at justifying commercial piracy simply don't cut it.
This kind of piracy is rampant and just plain wrong. It doesn't
transform the content it steals; it doesn't transform the market it
competes in. It merely gives someone access to something that the
law says he should not have. Nothing has changed to draw that law
into doubt. This form of piracy is flat out wrong.</p>
<p>But as the examples from the four chapters that introduced this
part suggest, even if some piracy is plainly wrong, not all
"piracy" is. Or at least, not all "piracy" is wrong if that term is
understood in the way it is increasingly used today. Many kinds of
"piracy" are useful and productive, to produce either new content
or new ways of doing business. Neither our tradition nor any
tradition has ever banned all "piracy" in that sense of the
term.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean that there are no questions raised by the
latest piracy concern, peer-to-peer file sharing. But it does mean
that we need to understand the harm in peer-to-peer sharing a bit
more before we condemn it to the gallows with the charge of
piracy.</p>
<p>For (1) like the original Hollywood, p2p sharing escapes an
overly controlling industry; and (2) like the original recording
industry, it simply exploits a new way to distribute content; but
(3) unlike cable TV, no one is selling the content that is shared
on p2p services.</p>
<p>These differences distinguish p2p sharing from true piracy. They
should push us to find a way to protect artists while enabling this
sharing to survive.</p>
