<h3 class="section_title">6. Liberate the Music—Again</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The battle that got this whole war going was about music, so it
wouldn't be fair to end this book without addressing the issue that
is, to most people, most pressing—music. There is no other policy
issue that better teaches the lessons of this book than the battles
around the sharing of music.</p>
<p>The appeal of file-sharing music was the crack cocaine of the
Internet's growth. It drove demand for access to the Internet more
powerfully than any other single application. It was the Internet's
killer app—possibly in two senses of that word. It no doubt was the
application that drove demand for bandwidth. It may well be the
application that drives demand for regulations that in the end kill
innovation on the network.</p>
<p>The aim of copyright, with respect to content in general and
music in particular, is to create the incentives for music to be
composed, performed, and, most importantly, spread. The law does
this by giving an exclusive right to a composer to control public
performances of his work, and to a performing artist to control
copies of her performance.</p>
<p>File-sharing networks complicate this model by enabling the
spread of content for which the performer has not been paid. But of
course, that's not all the file-sharing networks do. As I described
in chapter 5, they enable four different kinds of sharing:</p>
<p>A. There are some who are using sharing networks as substitutes
for purchasing CDs.</p>
<p>B. There are also some who are using sharing networks to sample,
on the way to purchasing CDs.</p>
<p>C. There are many who are using file-sharing networks to get
access to content that is no longer sold but is still under
copyright or that would have been too cumbersome to buy off the
Net.</p>
<p>D. There are many who are using file-sharing networks to get
access to content that is not copyrighted or to get access that the
copyright owner plainly endorses.</p>
<p>Any reform of the law needs to keep these different uses in
focus. It must avoid burdening type D even if it aims to eliminate
type A. The eagerness with which the law aims to eliminate type A,
moreover, should depend upon the magnitude of type B. As with VCRs,
if the net effect of sharing is actually not very harmful, the need
for regulation is significantly weakened.</p>
<p>As I said in chapter 5, the actual harm caused by sharing is
controversial. For the purposes of this chapter, however, I assume
the harm is real. I assume, in other words, that type A sharing is
significantly greater than type B, and is the dominant use of
sharing networks.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there is a crucial fact about the current
technological context that we must keep in mind if we are to
understand how the law should respond.</p>
<p>Today, file sharing is addictive. In ten years, it won't be. It
is addictive today because it is the easiest way to gain access to
a broad range of content. It won't be the easiest way to get access
to a broad range of content in ten years. Today, access to the
Internet is cumbersome and slow—we in the United States are lucky
to have broadband service at 1.5 MBs, and very rarely do we get
service at that speed both up and down. Although wireless access is
growing, most of us still get access across wires. Most only gain
access through a machine with a keyboard. The idea of the always
on, always connected Internet is mainly just an idea.</p>
<p>But it will become a reality, and that means the way we get
access to the Internet today is a technology in transition. Policy
makers should not make policy on the basis of technology in
transition. They should make policy on the basis of where the
technology is going. The question should not be, how should the law
regulate sharing in this world? The question should be, what law
will we require when the network becomes the network it is clearly
becoming? That network is one in which every machine with
electricity is essentially on the Net; where everywhere you
are—except maybe the desert or the Rockies—you can instantaneously
be connected to the Internet. Imagine the Internet as ubiquitous as
the best cell-phone service, where with the flip of a device, you
are connected.</p>
<p>In that world, it will be extremely easy to connect to services
that give you access to content on the fly—such as Internet radio,
content that is streamed to the user when the user demands. Here,
then, is the critical point: When it is extremely easy to connect
to services that give access to content, it will be easier to
connect to services that give you access to content than it will be
to download and store content on the many devices you will have for
playing content. It will be easier, in other words, to subscribe
than it will be to be a database manager, as everyone in the
download-sharing world of Napster-like technologies essentially is.
Content services will compete with content sharing, even if the
services charge money for the content they give access to. Already
cell-phone services in Japan offer music (for a fee) streamed over
cell phones (enhanced with plugs for headphones). The Japanese are
paying for this content even though "free" content is available in
the form of MP3s across the Web.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_219" id="footnote_219_call">[219]</a></p>
<p>This point about the future is meant to suggest a perspective on
the present: It is emphatically temporary. The "problem" with file
sharing—to the extent there is a real problem—is a problem that
will increasingly disappear as it becomes easier to connect to the
Internet. And thus it is an extraordinary mistake for policy makers
today to be "solving" this problem in light of a technology that
will be gone tomorrow. The question should not be how to regulate
the Internet to eliminate file sharing (the Net will evolve that
problem away). The question instead should be how to assure that
artists get paid, during this transition between twentieth-century
models for doing business and twenty-first-century
technologies.</p>
<p>The answer begins with recognizing that there are different
"problems" here to solve. Let's start with type D
content—uncopyrighted content or copyrighted content that the
artist wants shared. The "problem" with this content is to make
sure that the technology that would enable this kind of sharing is
not rendered illegal. You can think of it this way: Pay phones are
used to deliver ransom demands, no doubt. But there are many who
need to use pay phones who have nothing to do with ransoms. It
would be wrong to ban pay phones in order to eliminate
kidnapping.</p>
<p>Type C content raises a different "problem." This is content
that was, at one time, published and is no longer available. It may
be unavailable because the artist is no longer valuable enough for
the record label he signed with to carry his work. Or it may be
unavailable because the work is forgotten. Either way, the aim of
the law should be to facilitate the access to this content, ideally
in a way that returns something to the artist.</p>
<p>Again, the model here is the used book store. Once a book goes
out of print, it may still be available in libraries and used book
stores. But libraries and used book stores don't pay the copyright
owner when someone reads or buys an out-of-print book. That makes
total sense, of course, since any other system would be so
burdensome as to eliminate the possibility of used book stores'
existing. But from the author's perspective, this "sharing" of his
content without his being compensated is less than ideal.</p>
<p>The model of used book stores suggests that the law could simply
deem out-of-print music fair game. If the publisher does not make
copies of the music available for sale, then commercial and
noncommercial providers would be free, under this rule, to "share"
that content, even though the sharing involved making a copy. The
copy here would be incidental to the trade; in a context where
commercial publishing has ended, trading music should be as free as
trading books.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the law could create a statutory license that
would ensure that artists get something from the trade of their
work. For example, if the law set a low statutory rate for the
commercial sharing of content that was not offered for sale by a
commercial publisher, and if that rate were automatically
transferred to a trust for the benefit of the artist, then
businesses could develop around the idea of trading this content,
and artists would benefit from this trade.</p>
<p>This system would also create an incentive for publishers to
keep works available commercially. Works that are available
commercially would not be subject to this license. Thus, publishers
could protect the right to charge whatever they want for content if
they kept the work commercially available. But if they don't keep
it available, and instead, the computer hard disks of fans around
the world keep it alive, then any royalty owed for such copying
should be much less than the amount owed a commercial
publisher.</p>
<p>The hard case is content of types A and B, and again, this case
is hard only because the extent of the problem will change over
time, as the technologies for gaining access to content change. The
law's solution should be as flexible as the problem is,
understanding that we are in the middle of a radical transformation
in the technology for delivering and accessing content.</p>
<p>So here's a solution that will at first seem very strange to
both sides in this war, but which upon reflection, I suggest,
should make some sense.</p>
<p>Stripped of the rhetoric about the sanctity of property, the
basic claim of the content industry is this: A new technology (the
Internet) has harmed a set of rights that secure copyright. If
those rights are to be protected, then the content industry should
be compensated for that harm. Just as the technology of tobacco
harmed the health of millions of Americans, or the technology of
asbestos caused grave illness to thousands of miners, so, too, has
the technology of digital networks harmed the interests of the
content industry.</p>
<p>I love the Internet, and so I don't like likening it to tobacco
or asbestos. But the analogy is a fair one from the perspective of
the law. And it suggests a fair response: Rather than seeking to
destroy the Internet, or the p2p technologies that are currently
harming content providers on the Internet, we should find a
relatively simple way to compensate those who are harmed.</p>
<p>The idea would be a modification of a proposal that has been
floated by Harvard law professor William Fisher.<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_220" id="footnote_220_call">[220]</a>
Fisher suggests a very clever way around the current impasse of the
Internet. Under his plan, all content capable of digital
transmission would (1) be marked with a digital watermark (don't
worry about how easy it is to evade these marks; as you'll see,
there's no incentive to evade them). Once the content is marked,
then entrepreneurs would develop (2) systems to monitor how many
items of each content were distributed. On the basis of those
numbers, then (3) artists would be compensated. The compensation
would be paid for by (4) an appropriate tax.</p>
<p>Fisher's proposal is careful and comprehensive. It raises a
million questions, most of which he answers well in his upcoming
book, Promises to Keep. The modification that I would make is
relatively simple: Fisher imagines his proposal replacing the
existing copyright system. I imagine it complementing the existing
system. The aim of the proposal would be to facilitate compensation
to the extent that harm could be shown. This compensation would be
temporary, aimed at facilitating a transition between regimes. And
it would require renewal after a period of years. If it continues
to make sense to facilitate free exchange of content, supported
through a taxation system, then it can be continued. If this form
of protection is no longer necessary, then the system could lapse
into the old system of controlling access.</p>
<p>Fisher would balk at the idea of allowing the system to lapse.
His aim is not just to ensure that artists are paid, but also to
ensure that the system supports the widest range of "semiotic
democracy" possible. But the aims of semiotic democracy would be
satisfied if the other changes I described were accomplished—in
particular, the limits on derivative uses. A system that simply
charges for access would not greatly burden semiotic democracy if
there were few limitations on what one was allowed to do with the
content itself.</p>
<p>No doubt it would be difficult to calculate the proper measure
of "harm" to an industry. But the difficulty of making that
calculation would be outweighed by the benefit of facilitating
innovation. This background system to compensate would also not
need to interfere with innovative proposals such as Apple's
MusicStore. As experts predicted when Apple launched the
MusicStore, it could beat "free" by being easier than free is. This
has proven correct: Apple has sold millions of songs at even the
very high price of 99 cents a song. (At 99 cents, the cost is the
equivalent of a per-song CD price, though the labels have none of
the costs of a CD to pay.) Apple's move was countered by Real
Networks, offering music at just 79 cents a song. And no doubt
there will be a great deal of competition to offer and sell music
on-line.</p>
<p>This competition has already occurred against the background of
"free" music from p2p systems. As the sellers of cable television
have known for thirty years, and the sellers of bottled water for
much more than that, there is nothing impossible at all about
"competing with free." Indeed, if anything, the competition spurs
the competitors to offer new and better products. This is precisely
what the competitive market was to be about. Thus in Singapore,
though piracy is rampant, movie theaters are often luxurious—with
"first class" seats, and meals served while you watch a movie—as
they struggle and succeed in finding ways to compete with
"free."</p>
<p>This regime of competition, with a backstop to assure that
artists don't lose, would facilitate a great deal of innovation in
the delivery of content. That competition would continue to shrink
type A sharing. It would inspire an extraordinary range of new
innovators—ones who would have a right to the content, and would no
longer fear the uncertain and barbarically severe punishments of
the law.</p>
<p>In summary, then, my proposal is this:</p>
<p>The Internet is in transition. We should not be regulating a
technology in transition. We should instead be regulating to
minimize the harm to interests affected by this technological
change, while enabling, and encouraging, the most efficient
technology we can create.</p>
<p>We can minimize that harm while maximizing the benefit to
innovation by</p>
<p>1. guaranteeing the right to engage in type D sharing;</p>
<p>2. permitting noncommercial type C sharing without liability,
and commercial type C sharing at a low and fixed rate set by
statute;</p>
<p>3. while in this transition, taxing and compensating for type A
sharing, to the extent actual harm is demonstrated.</p>
<p>But what if "piracy" doesn't disappear? What if there is a
competitive market providing content at a low cost, but a
significant number of consumers continue to "take" content for
nothing? Should the law do something then?</p>
<p>Yes, it should. But, again, what it should do depends upon how
the facts develop. These changes may not eliminate type A sharing.
But the real issue is not whether it eliminates sharing in the
abstract. The real issue is its effect on the market. Is it better
(a) to have a technology that is 95 percent secure and produces a
market of size x, or (b) to have a technology that is 50 percent
secure but produces a market of five times x? Less secure might
produce more unauthorized sharing, but it is likely to also produce
a much bigger market in authorized sharing. The most important
thing is to assure artists' compensation without breaking the
Internet. Once that's assured, then it may well be appropriate to
find ways to track down the petty pirates.</p>
<p>But we're a long way away from whittling the problem down to
this subset of type A sharers. And our focus until we're there
should not be on finding ways to break the Internet. Our focus
until we're there should be on how to make sure the artists are
paid, while protecting the space for innovation and creativity that
the Internet is.</p>
