<p>Common sense is with the copyright warriors because the debate
so far has been framed at the extremes—as a grand either/or: either
property or anarchy, either total control or artists won't be paid.
If that really is the choice, then the warriors should win.</p>
<p>The mistake here is the error of the excluded middle. There are
extremes in this debate, but the extremes are not all that there
is. There are those who believe in maximal copyright—"All Rights
Reserved"— and those who reject copyright—"No Rights Reserved." The
"All Rights Reserved" sorts believe that you should ask permission
before you "use" a copyrighted work in any way. The "No Rights
Reserved" sorts believe you should be able to do with content as
you wish, regardless of whether you have permission or not.</p>
<p>When the Internet was first born, its initial architecture
effectively tilted in the "no rights reserved" direction. Content
could be copied perfectly and cheaply; rights could not easily be
controlled. Thus, regardless of anyone's desire, the effective
regime of copyright under the original design of the Internet was
"no rights reserved." Content was "taken" regardless of the rights.
Any rights were effectively unprotected.</p>
<p>This initial character produced a reaction (opposite, but not
quite equal) by copyright owners. That reaction has been the topic
of this book. Through legislation, litigation, and changes to the
network's design, copyright holders have been able to change the
essential character of the environment of the original Internet. If
the original architecture made the effective default "no rights
reserved," the future architecture will make the effective default
"all rights reserved." The architecture and law that surround the
Internet's design will increasingly produce an environment where
all use of content requires permission. The "cut and paste" world
that defines the Internet today will become a "get permission to
cut and paste" world that is a creator's nightmare.</p>
<p>What's needed is a way to say something in the middle—neither
"all rights reserved" nor "no rights reserved" but "some rights
reserved"— and thus a way to respect copyrights but enable creators
to free content as they see fit. In other words, we need a way to
restore a set of freedoms that we could just take for granted
before.</p>
