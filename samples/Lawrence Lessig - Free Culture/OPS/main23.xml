<h3 class="section_title">1. Why Hollywood Is Right</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The most obvious point that this model reveals is just why, or
just how, Hollywood is right. The copyright warriors have rallied
Congress and the courts to defend copyright. This model helps us
see why that rallying makes sense.</p>
<p>Let's say this is the picture of copyright's regulation before
the Internet:</p>
<p>(Figure 5.3)</p>
<p>There is balance between law, norms, market, and architecture.
The law limits the ability to copy and share content, by imposing
penalties on those who copy and share content. Those penalties are
reinforced by technologies that make it hard to copy and share
content (architecture) and expensive to copy and share content
(market). Finally, those penalties are mitigated by norms we all
recognize—kids, for example, taping other kids' records. These uses
of copyrighted material may well be infringement, but the norms of
our society (before the Internet, at least) had no problem with
this form of infringement.</p>
<p>Enter the Internet, or, more precisely, technologies such as
MP3s and p2p sharing. Now the constraint of architecture changes
dramatically, as does the constraint of the market. And as both the
market and architecture relax the regulation of copyright, norms
pile on. The happy balance (for the warriors, at least) of life
before the Internet becomes an effective state of anarchy after the
Internet.</p>
<p>Thus the sense of, and justification for, the warriors'
response. Technology has changed, the warriors say, and the effect
of this change, when ramified through the market and norms, is that
a balance of protection for the copyright owners' rights has been
lost. This is Iraq after the fall of Saddam, but this time no
government is justifying the looting that results.</p>
<p>(Figure 5.4)</p>
<p>Neither this analysis nor the conclusions that follow are new to
the warriors. Indeed, in a "White Paper" prepared by the Commerce
Department (one heavily influenced by the copyright warriors) in
1995, this mix of regulatory modalities had already been identified
and the strategy to respond already mapped. In response to the
changes the Internet had effected, the White Paper argued (1)
Congress should strengthen intellectual property law, (2)
businesses should adopt innovative marketing techniques, (3)
technologists should push to develop code to protect copyrighted
material, and (4) educators should educate kids to better protect
copyright.</p>
<p>This mixed strategy is just what copyright needed—if it was to
preserve the particular balance that existed before the change
induced by the Internet. And it's just what we should expect the
content industry to push for. It is as American as apple pie to
consider the happy life you have as an entitlement, and to look to
the law to protect it if something comes along to change that happy
life. Homeowners living in a flood plain have no hesitation
appealing to the government to rebuild (and rebuild again) when a
flood (architecture) wipes away their property (law). Farmers have
no hesitation appealing to the government to bail them out when a
virus (architecture) devastates their crop. Unions have no
hesitation appealing to the government to bail them out when
imports (market) wipe out the U.S. steel industry.</p>
<p>Thus, there's nothing wrong or surprising in the content
industry's campaign to protect itself from the harmful consequences
of a technological innovation. And I would be the last person to
argue that the changing technology of the Internet has not had a
profound effect on the content industry's way of doing business, or
as John Seely Brown describes it, its "architecture of
revenue."</p>
<p>But just because a particular interest asks for government
support, it doesn't follow that support should be granted. And just
because technology has weakened a particular way of doing business,
it doesn't follow that the government should intervene to support
that old way of doing business. Kodak, for example, has lost
perhaps as much as 20 percent of their traditional film market to
the emerging technologies of digital cameras.<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_122" id="footnote_122_call">[122]</a>
Does anyone believe the government should ban digital cameras just
to support Kodak? Highways have weakened the freight business for
railroads. Does anyone think we should ban trucks from roads for
the purpose of protecting the railroads? Closer to the subject of
this book, remote channel changers have weakened the "stickiness"
of television advertising (if a boring commercial comes on the TV,
the remote makes it easy to surf ), and it may well be that this
change has weakened the television advertising market. But does
anyone believe we should regulate remotes to reinforce commercial
television? (Maybe by limiting them to function only once a second,
or to switch to only ten channels within an hour?)</p>
<p>The obvious answer to these obviously rhetorical questions is
no. In a free society, with a free market, supported by free
enterprise and free trade, the government's role is not to support
one way of doing business against others. Its role is not to pick
winners and protect them against loss. If the government did this
generally, then we would never have any progress. As Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates wrote in 1991, in a memo criticizing software
patents, "established companies have an interest in excluding
future competitors."<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_123" id="footnote_123_call">[123]</a> And
relative to a startup, established companies also have the means.
(Think RCA and FM radio.) A world in which competitors with new
ideas must fight not only the market but also the government is a
world in which competitors with new ideas will not succeed. It is a
world of stasis and increasingly concentrated stagnation. It is the
Soviet Union under Brezhnev.</p>
<p>Thus, while it is understandable for industries threatened with
new technologies that change the way they do business to look to
the government for protection, it is the special duty of policy
makers to guarantee that that protection not become a deterrent to
progress. It is the duty of policy makers, in other words, to
assure that the changes they create, in response to the request of
those hurt by changing technology, are changes that preserve the
incentives and opportunities for innovation and change.</p>
<p>In the context of laws regulating speech—which include,
obviously, copyright law—that duty is even stronger. When the
industry complaining about changing technologies is asking Congress
to respond in a way that burdens speech and creativity, policy
makers should be especially wary of the request. It is always a bad
deal for the government to get into the business of regulating
speech markets. The risks and dangers of that game are precisely
why our framers created the First Amendment to our Constitution:
"Congress shall make no law&#160;… abridging the freedom of
speech." So when Congress is being asked to pass laws that would
"abridge" the freedom of speech, it should ask— carefully—whether
such regulation is justified.</p>
<p>My argument just now, however, has nothing to do with whether
the changes that are being pushed by the copyright warriors are
"justified." My argument is about their effect. For before we get
to the question of justification, a hard question that depends a
great deal upon your values, we should first ask whether we
understand the effect of the changes the content industry
wants.</p>
<p>Here's the metaphor that will capture the argument to
follow.</p>
<p>In 1873, the chemical DDT was first synthesized. In 1948, Swiss
chemist Paul Hermann Müller won the Nobel Prize for his work
demonstrating the insecticidal properties of DDT. By the 1950s, the
insecticide was widely used around the world to kill
disease-carrying pests. It was also used to increase farm
production.</p>
<p>No one doubts that killing disease-carrying pests or increasing
crop production is a good thing. No one doubts that the work of
Müller was important and valuable and probably saved lives,
possibly millions.</p>
<p>But in 1962, Rachel Carson published Silent Spring, which argued
that DDT, whatever its primary benefits, was also having unintended
environmental consequences. Birds were losing the ability to
reproduce. Whole chains of the ecology were being destroyed.</p>
<p>No one set out to destroy the environment. Paul Müller certainly
did not aim to harm any birds. But the effort to solve one set of
problems produced another set which, in the view of some, was far
worse than the problems that were originally attacked. Or more
accurately, the problems DDT caused were worse than the problems it
solved, at least when considering the other, more environmentally
friendly ways to solve the problems that DDT was meant to
solve.</p>
<p>It is to this image precisely that Duke University law professor
James Boyle appeals when he argues that we need an
"environmentalism" for culture.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_124" id="footnote_124_call">[124]</a> His
point, and the point I want to develop in the balance of this
chapter, is not that the aims of copyright are flawed. Or that
authors should not be paid for their work. Or that music should be
given away "for free." The point is that some of the ways in which
we might protect authors will have unintended consequences for the
cultural environment, much like DDT had for the natural
environment. And just as criticism of DDT is not an endorsement of
malaria or an attack on farmers, so, too, is criticism of one
particular set of regulations protecting copyright not an
endorsement of anarchy or an attack on authors. It is an
environment of creativity that we seek, and we should be aware of
our actions' effects on the environment.</p>
<p>My argument, in the balance of this chapter, tries to map
exactly this effect. No doubt the technology of the Internet has
had a dramatic effect on the ability of copyright owners to protect
their content. But there should also be little doubt that when you
add together the changes in copyright law over time, plus the
change in technology that the Internet is undergoing just now, the
net effect of these changes will not be only that copyrighted work
is effectively protected. Also, and generally missed, the net
effect of this massive increase in protection will be devastating
to the environment for creativity.</p>
<p>In a line: To kill a gnat, we are spraying DDT with consequences
for free culture that will be far more devastating than that this
gnat will be lost.</p>
