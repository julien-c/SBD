<p>There is something innocent and obvious about the claim of the
copyright warriors that the government should "protect my
property." In the abstract, it is obviously true and, ordinarily,
totally harmless. No sane sort who is not an anarchist could
disagree.</p>
<p>But when we see how dramatically this "property" has changed—
when we recognize how it might now interact with both technology
and markets to mean that the effective constraint on the liberty to
cultivate our culture is dramatically different—the claim begins to
seem less innocent and obvious. Given (1) the power of technology
to supplement the law's control, and (2) the power of concentrated
markets to weaken the opportunity for dissent, if strictly
enforcing the massively expanded "property" rights granted by
copyright fundamentally changes the freedom within this culture to
cultivate and build upon our past, then we have to ask whether this
property should be redefined.</p>
<p>Not starkly. Or absolutely. My point is not that we should
abolish copyright or go back to the eighteenth century. That would
be a total mistake, disastrous for the most important creative
enterprises within our culture today.</p>
<p>But there is a space between zero and one, Internet culture
notwithstanding. And these massive shifts in the effective power of
copyright regulation, tied to increased concentration of the
content industry and resting in the hands of technology that will
increasingly enable control over the use of culture, should drive
us to consider whether another adjustment is called for. Not an
adjustment that increases copyright's power. Not an adjustment that
increases its term. Rather, an adjustment to restore the balance
that has traditionally defined copyright's regulation—a weakening
of that regulation, to strengthen creativity.</p>
<p>Copyright law has not been a rock of Gibraltar. It's not a set
of constant commitments that, for some mysterious reason, teenagers
and geeks now flout. Instead, copyright power has grown
dramatically in a short period of time, as the technologies of
distribution and creation have changed and as lobbyists have pushed
for more control by copyright holders. Changes in the past in
response to changes in technology suggest that we may well need
similar changes in the future. And these changes have to be
reductions in the scope of copyright, in response to the
extraordinary increase in control that technology and the market
enable.</p>
<p>For the single point that is lost in this war on pirates is a
point that we see only after surveying the range of these changes.
When you add together the effect of changing law, concentrated
markets, and changing technology, together they produce an
astonishing conclusion: Never in our history have fewer had a legal
right to control more of the development of our culture than
now.</p>
<p>Not when copyrights were perpetual, for when copyrights were
perpetual, they affected only that precise creative work. Not when
only publishers had the tools to publish, for the market then was
much more diverse. Not when there were only three television
networks, for even then, newspapers, film studios, radio stations,
and publishers were independent of the networks. Never has
copyright protected such a wide range of rights, against as broad a
range of actors, for a term that was remotely as long. This form of
regulation—a tiny regulation of a tiny part of the creative energy
of a nation at the founding—is now a massive regulation of the
overall creative process. Law plus technology plus the market now
interact to turn this historically benign regulation into the most
significant regulation of culture that our free society has
known.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_152" id=

<p>This has been a long chapter. Its point can now be briefly
stated.</p>
<p>At the start of this book, I distinguished between commercial
and noncommercial culture. In the course of this chapter, I have
distinguished between copying a work and transforming it. We can
now combine these two distinctions and draw a clear map of the
changes that copyright law has undergone. In 1790, the law looked
like this:</p>
<p><strong>Table 5-1.</strong></p>
<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>PUBLISH</td>
<td>TRANSFORM</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Commercial</td>
<td>©</td>
<td>Free</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noncommercial</td>
<td>Free</td>
<td>Free</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The act of publishing a map, chart, and book was regulated by
copyright law. Nothing else was. Transformations were free. And as
copyright attached only with registration, and only those who
intended to benefit commercially would register, copying through
publishing of noncommercial work was also free.</p>
<p>By the end of the nineteenth century, the law had changed to
this:</p>
<p><strong>Table 5-2.</strong></p>
<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>PUBLISH</td>
<td>TRANSFORM</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Commercial</td>
<td>©</td>
<td>©</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noncommercial</td>
<td>Free</td>
<td>Free</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Derivative works were now regulated by copyright law—if
published, which again, given the economics of publishing at the
time, means if offered commercially. But noncommercial publishing
and transformation were still essentially free.</p>
<p>In 1909 the law changed to regulate copies, not publishing, and
after this change, the scope of the law was tied to technology. As
the technology of copying became more prevalent, the reach of the
law expanded. Thus by 1975, as photocopying machines became more
common, we could say the law began to look like this:</p>
<p><strong>Table 5-3.</strong></p>
<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>PUBLISH</td>
<td>TRANSFORM</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Commercial</td>
<td>©</td>
<td>©</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noncommercial</td>
<td>©/Free</td>
<td>Free</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The law was interpreted to reach noncommercial copying through,
say, copy machines, but still much of copying outside of the
commercial market remained free. But the consequence of the
emergence of digital technologies, especially in the context of a
digital network, means that the law now looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>Table 5-4.</strong></p>
<table>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>PUBLISH</td>
<td>TRANSFORM</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Commercial</td>
<td>©</td>
<td>©</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Noncommercial</td>
<td>©</td>
<td>©</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Every realm is governed by copyright law, whereas before most
creativity was not. The law now regulates the full range of
creativity— commercial or not, transformative or not—with the same
rules designed to regulate commercial publishers.</p>
<p>Obviously, copyright law is not the enemy. The enemy is
regulation that does no good. So the question that we should be
asking just now is whether extending the regulations of copyright
law into each of these domains actually does any good.</p>
<p>I have no doubt that it does good in regulating commercial
copying. But I also have no doubt that it does more harm than good
when regulating (as it regulates just now) noncommercial copying
and, especially, noncommercial transformation. And increasingly,
for the reasons sketched especially in chapters 7 and 8, one might
well wonder whether it does more harm than good for commercial
transformation. More commercial transformative work would be
created if derivative rights were more sharply restricted.</p>
<p>The issue is therefore not simply whether copyright is property.
Of course copyright is a kind of "property," and of course, as with
any property, the state ought to protect it. But first impressions
notwithstanding, historically, this property right (as with all
property rights<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_153" id="footnote_153_call">[153]</a> ) has
been crafted to balance the important need to give authors and
artists incentives with the equally important need to assure access
to creative work. This balance has always been struck in light of
new technologies. And for almost half of our tradition, the
"copyright" did not control at all the freedom of others to build
upon or transform a creative work. American culture was born free,
and for almost 180 years our country consistently protected a
vibrant and rich free culture.</p>
<p>We achieved that free culture because our law respected
important limits on the scope of the interests protected by
"property." The very birth of "copyright" as a statutory right
recognized those limits, by granting copyright owners protection
for a limited time only (the story of chapter 6). The tradition of
"fair use" is animated by a similar concern that is increasingly
under strain as the costs of exercising any fair use right become
unavoidably high (the story of chapter 7). Adding statutory rights
where markets might stifle innovation is another familiar limit on
the property right that copyright is (chapter 8). And granting
archives and libraries a broad freedom to collect, claims of
property notwithstanding, is a crucial part of guaranteeing the
soul of a culture (chapter 9). Free cultures, like free markets,
are built with property. But the nature of the property that builds
a free culture is very different from the extremist vision that
dominates the debate today.</p>
<p>Free culture is increasingly the casualty in this war on piracy.
In response to a real, if not yet quantified, threat that the
technologies of the Internet present to twentieth-century business
models for producing and distributing culture, the law and
technology are being transformed in a way that will undermine our
tradition of free culture. The property right that is copyright is
no longer the balanced right that it was, or was intended to be.
The property right that is copyright has become unbalanced, tilted
toward an extreme. The opportunity to create and transform becomes
weakened in a world in which creation requires permission and
creativity must check with a lawyer.</p>
