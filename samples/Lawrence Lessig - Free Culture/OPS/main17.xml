<p>The copyright warriors are right: A copyright is a kind of
property. It can be owned and sold, and the law protects against
its theft. Ordinarily, the copyright owner gets to hold out for any
price he wants. Markets reckon the supply and demand that partially
determine the price she can get.</p>
<p>But in ordinary language, to call a copyright a "property" right
is a bit misleading, for the property of copyright is an odd kind
of property. Indeed, the very idea of property in any idea or any
expression is very odd. I understand what I am taking when I take
the picnic table you put in your backyard. I am taking a thing, the
picnic table, and after I take it, you don't have it. But what am I
taking when I take the good idea you had to put a picnic table in
the backyard—by, for example, going to Sears, buying a table, and
putting it in my backyard? What is the thing I am taking then?</p>
<p>The point is not just about the thingness of picnic tables
versus ideas, though that's an important difference. The point
instead is that in the ordinary case—indeed, in practically every
case except for a narrow range of exceptions—ideas released to the
world are free. I don't take anything from you when I copy the way
you dress—though I might seem weird if I did it every day, and
especially weird if you are a woman. Instead, as Thomas Jefferson
said (and as is especially true when I copy the way someone else
dresses), "He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction
himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine,
receives light without darkening me."<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_96" id="footnote_96_call">[96]</a></p>
<p>The exceptions to free use are ideas and expressions within the
reach of the law of patent and copyright, and a few other domains
that I won't discuss here. Here the law says you can't take my idea
or expression without my permission: The law turns the intangible
into property.</p>
<p>But how, and to what extent, and in what form—the details, in
other words—matter. To get a good sense of how this practice of
turning the intangible into property emerged, we need to place this
"property" in its proper context.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_97" id="footnote_97_call">[97]</a></p>
<p>My strategy in doing this will be the same as my strategy in the
preceding part. I offer four stories to help put the idea of
"copyright material is property" in context. Where did the idea
come from? What are its limits? How does it function in practice?
After these stories, the significance of this true
statement—"copyright material is property"— will be a bit more
clear, and its implications will be revealed as quite different
from the implications that the copyright warriors would have us
draw.</p>
