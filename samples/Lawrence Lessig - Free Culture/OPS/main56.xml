<p>Throughout this text, there are references to links on the World
Wide Web. As anyone who has tried to use the Web knows, these links
can be highly unstable. I have tried to remedy the instability by
redirecting readers to the original source through the Web site
associated with this book. For each link below, you can go to
http://free-culture.cc/notes and locate the original source by
clicking on the number after the # sign. If the original link
remains alive, you will be redirected to that link. If the original
link has disappeared, you will be redirected to an appropriate
reference for the material.</p>
