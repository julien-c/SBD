<p>Lawrence Lessig (born June 3, 1961) is an American academic and
political activist. He is a professor of law at Stanford Law School
and founder of its Center for Internet and Society. Lessig is
founding board member of Creative Commons and is a board member of
the Electronic Frontier Foundation and of the Software Freedom Law
Center. He is best known as a proponent of reduced legal
restrictions on copyright, trademark and radio frequency spectrum,
particularly in technology applications. At the iCommons iSummit 07
Lessig announced that he will stop focusing his attention on
copyright and related matters and will work on political corruption
instead. This new work may be partially facilitated through his
wiki — “Lessig Wiki” — which he has encouraged the public to use to
document cases of corruption. In February 2008, a Facebook group
formed by law professor John Palfrey encouraged him to run for
Congress from California's 12th congressional district, the seat
vacated by the death of U.S. Representative Tom Lantos. Later that
month, after forming an "exploratory project", the decision was
made not to run for the vacant seat. Despite having decided to
forgo running for congress himself, Lessig remained interested in
attempting to change Congress to reduce corruption. To this end, he
worked with political consultant Joe Trippi to launch a web based
project called "Change Congress." In a press conference on March
20, 2008, Lessig explained that he hoped the Change Congress
website would help provide technological tools voters could use to
hold their representatives accountable and reduce the influence of
money on politics. Source: Wikipedia</p>
