<h3 class="section_title">4. Cable TV</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Cable TV was also born of a kind of piracy.</p>
<p>When cable entrepreneurs first started wiring communities with
cable television in 1948, most refused to pay broadcasters for the
content that they echoed to their customers. Even when the cable
companies started selling access to television broadcasts, they
refused to pay for what they sold. Cable companies were thus
Napsterizing broadcasters' content, but more egregiously than
anything Napster ever did— Napster never charged for the content it
enabled others to give away.</p>
<p>Broadcasters and copyright owners were quick to attack this
theft. Rosel Hyde, chairman of the FCC, viewed the practice as a
kind of "unfair and potentially destructive competition."<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_63" id=
"footnote_63_call">[63]</a> There may have been a "public interest"
in spreading the reach of cable TV, but as Douglas Anello, general
counsel to the National Association of Broadcasters, asked Senator
Quentin Burdick during testimony, "Does public interest dictate
that you use somebody else's property?"<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_64" id="footnote_64_call">[64]</a> As
another broadcaster put it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The extraordinary thing about the CATV business is that it is
the only business I know of where the product that is being sold is
not paid for.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_65"
id="footnote_65_call">[65]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, the demand of the copyright holders seemed reasonable
enough:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All we are asking for is a very simple thing, that people who
now take our property for nothing pay for it. We are trying to stop
piracy and I don't think there is any lesser word to describe it. I
think there are harsher words which would fit it.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_66" id=
"footnote_66_call">[66]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These were "free-ride[rs]," Screen Actor's Guild president
Charlton Heston said, who were "depriving actors of
compensation."<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_67"
id="footnote_67_call">[67]</a></p>
<p>But again, there was another side to the debate. As Assistant
Attorney General Edwin Zimmerman put it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our point here is that unlike the problem of whether you have
any copyright protection at all, the problem here is whether
copyright holders who are already compensated, who already have a
monopoly, should be permitted to extend that monopoly… . The
question here is how much compensation they should have and how far
back they should carry their right to compensation.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_68" id=
"footnote_68_call">[68]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Copyright owners took the cable companies to court. Twice the
Supreme Court held that the cable companies owed the copyright
owners nothing.</p>
<p>It took Congress almost thirty years before it resolved the
question of whether cable companies had to pay for the content they
"pirated." In the end, Congress resolved this question in the same
way that it resolved the question about record players and player
pianos. Yes, cable companies would have to pay for the content that
they broadcast; but the price they would have to pay was not set by
the copyright owner. The price was set by law, so that the
broadcasters couldn't exercise veto power over the emerging
technologies of cable. Cable companies thus built their empire in
part upon a "piracy" of the value created by broadcasters'
content.</p>
<p>These separate stories sing a common theme. If "piracy" means
using value from someone else's creative property without
permission from that creator—as it is increasingly described
today<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_69" id=
"footnote_69_call">[69]</a> — then every industry affected by
copyright today is the product and beneficiary of a certain kind of
piracy. Film, records, radio, cable TV… . The list is long and
could well be expanded. Every generation welcomes the pirates from
the last. Every generation—until now.</p>
