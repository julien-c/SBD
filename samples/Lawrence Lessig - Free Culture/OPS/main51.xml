<div class="text">
<p>It used to be that the failure to include a copyright notice on
a creative work meant that the copyright was forfeited. That was a
harsh punishment for failing to comply with a regulatory rule—akin
to imposing the death penalty for a parking ticket in the world of
creative rights. Here again, there is no reason that a marking
requirement needs to be enforced in this way. And more importantly,
there is no reason a marking requirement needs to be enforced
uniformly across all media.</p>
<p>The aim of marking is to signal to the public that this work is
copyrighted and that the author wants to enforce his rights. The
mark also makes it easy to locate a copyright owner to secure
permission to use the work.</p>
<p>One of the problems the copyright system confronted early on was
that different copyrighted works had to be differently marked. It
wasn't clear how or where a statue was to be marked, or a record,
or a film. A new marking requirement could solve these problems by
recognizing the differences in media, and by allowing the system of
marking to evolve as technologies enable it to. The system could
enable a special signal from the failure to mark—not the loss of
the copyright, but the loss of the right to punish someone for
failing to get permission first.</p>
<p>Let's start with the last point. If a copyright owner allows his
work to be published without a copyright notice, the consequence of
that failure need not be that the copyright is lost. The
consequence could instead be that anyone has the right to use this
work, until the copyright owner complains and demonstrates that it
is his work and he doesn't give permission.<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_213" id="footnote_213_call">[213]</a>
The meaning of an unmarked work would therefore be "use unless
someone complains." If someone does complain, then the obligation
would be to stop using the work in any new work from then on though
no penalty would attach for existing uses. This would create a
strong incentive for copyright owners to mark their work.</p>
<p>That in turn raises the question about how work should best be
marked. Here again, the system needs to adjust as the technologies
evolve. The best way to ensure that the system evolves is to limit
the Copyright Office's role to that of approving standards for
marking content that have been crafted elsewhere.</p>
<p>For example, if a recording industry association devises a
method for marking CDs, it would propose that to the Copyright
Office. The Copyright Office would hold a hearing, at which other
proposals could be made. The Copyright Office would then select the
proposal that it judged preferable, and it would base that choice
solely upon the consideration of which method could best be
integrated into the registration and renewal system. We would not
count on the government to innovate; but we would count on the
government to keep the product of innovation in line with its other
important functions.</p>
<p>Finally, marking content clearly would simplify registration
requirements. If photographs were marked by author and year, there
would be little reason not to allow a photographer to reregister,
for example, all photographs taken in a particular year in one
quick step. The aim of the formality is not to burden the creator;
the system itself should be kept as simple as possible.</p>
<p>The objective of formalities is to make things clear. The
existing system does nothing to make things clear. Indeed, it seems
designed to make things unclear.</p>
<p>If formalities such as registration were reinstated, one of the
most difficult aspects of relying upon the public domain would be
removed. It would be simple to identify what content is
presumptively free; it would be simple to identify who controls the
rights for a particular kind of content; it would be simple to
assert those rights, and to renew that assertion at the appropriate
time.</p>
