<p>The film industry of Hollywood was built by fleeing
pirates.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_51" id=
"footnote_51_call">[51]</a> Creators and directors migrated from
the East Coast to California in the early twentieth century in part
to escape controls that patents granted the inventor of filmmaking,
Thomas Edison. These controls were exercised through a monopoly
"trust," the Motion Pictures Patents Company, and were based on
Thomas Edison's creative propertyâ€”patents. Edison formed the MPPC
to exercise the rights this creative property gave him, and the
MPPC was serious about the control it demanded.</p>
<p>As one commentator tells one part of the story,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A January 1909 deadline was set for all companies to comply with
the license. By February, unlicensed outlaws, who referred to
themselves as independents protested the trust and carried on
business without submitting to the Edison monopoly. In the summer
of 1909 the independent movement was in full-swing, with producers
and theater owners using illegal equipment and imported film stock
to create their own underground market.</p>
<p>With the country experiencing a tremendous expansion in the
number of nickelodeons, the Patents Company reacted to the
independent movement by forming a strong-arm subsidiary known as
the General Film Company to block the entry of non-licensed
independents. With coercive tactics that have become legendary,
General Film confiscated unlicensed equipment, discontinued product
supply to theaters which showed unlicensed films, and effectively
monopolized distribution with the acquisition of all U.S. film
exchanges, except for the one owned by the independent William Fox
who defied the Trust even after his license was revoked.<a class=

"footnote_52_call">[52]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Napsters of those days, the "independents," were companies
like Fox. And no less than today, these independents were
vigorously resisted. "Shooting was disrupted by machinery stolen,
and `accidents' resulting in loss of negatives, equipment,
buildings and sometimes life and limb frequently
occurred."<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_53" id=
"footnote_53_call">[53]</a> That led the independents to flee the
East Coast. California was remote enough from Edison's reach that
filmmakers there could pirate his inventions without fear of the
law. And the leaders of Hollywood filmmaking, Fox most prominently,
did just that.</p>
<p>Of course, California grew quickly, and the effective
enforcement of federal law eventually spread west. But because
patents grant the patent holder a truly "limited" monopoly (just
seventeen years at that time), by the time enough federal marshals
appeared, the patents had expired. A new industry had been born, in
part from the piracy of Edison's creative property.</p>
