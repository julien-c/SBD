<p>America copied English copyright law. Actually, we copied and
improved English copyright law. Our Constitution makes the purpose
of "creative property" rights clear; its express limitations
reinforce the English aim to avoid overly powerful publishers.</p>
<p>The power to establish "creative property" rights is granted to
Congress in a way that, for our Constitution, at least, is very
odd. Article I, section 8, clause 8 of our Constitution states
that:</p>
<p>Congress has the power to promote the Progress of Science and
useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors
the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.
We can call this the "Progress Clause," for notice what this clause
does not say. It does not say Congress has the power to grant
"creative property rights." It says that Congress has the power to
promote progress. The grant of power is its purpose, and its
purpose is a public one, not the purpose of enriching publishers,
nor even primarily the purpose of rewarding authors.</p>
<p>The Progress Clause expressly limits the term of copyrights. As
we saw in chapter 6, the English limited the term of copyright so
as to assure that a few would not exercise disproportionate control
over culture by exercising disproportionate control over
publishing. We can assume the framers followed the English for a
similar purpose. Indeed, unlike the English, the framers reinforced
that objective, by requiring that copyrights extend "to Authors"
only.</p>
<p>The design of the Progress Clause reflects something about the
Constitution's design in general. To avoid a problem, the framers
built structure. To prevent the concentrated power of publishers,
they built a structure that kept copyrights away from publishers
and kept them short. To prevent the concentrated power of a church,
they banned the federal government from establishing a church. To
prevent concentrating power in the federal government, they built
structures to reinforce the power of the statesâ€”including the
Senate, whose members were at the time selected by the states, and
an electoral college, also selected by the states, to select the
president. In each case, a structure built checks and balances into
the constitutional frame, structured to prevent otherwise
inevitable concentrations of power.</p>
<p>I doubt the framers would recognize the regulation we call
"copyright" today. The scope of that regulation is far beyond
anything they ever considered. To begin to understand what they
did, we need to put our "copyright" in context: We need to see how
it has changed in the 210 years since they first struck its
design.</p>
<p>Some of these changes come from the law: some in light of
changes in technology, and some in light of changes in technology
given a particular concentration of market power. In terms of our
model, we started here:</p>

<p>We will end here:</p>

<p>Let me explain how.</p>
