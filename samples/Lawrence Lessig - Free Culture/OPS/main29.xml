<h3 class="section_title">7. Market: Concentration</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>So copyright's duration has increased dramatically—tripled in
the past thirty years. And copyright's scope has increased as
well—from regulating only publishers to now regulating just about
everyone. And copyright's reach has changed, as every action
becomes a copy and hence presumptively regulated. And as
technologists find better ways to control the use of content, and
as copyright is increasingly enforced through technology,
copyright's force changes, too. Misuse is easier to find and easier
to control. This regulation of the creative process, which began as
a tiny regulation governing a tiny part of the market for creative
work, has become the single most important regulator of creativity
there is. It is a massive expansion in the scope of the
government's control over innovation and creativity; it would be
totally unrecognizable to those who gave birth to copyright's
control.</p>
<p>Still, in my view, all of these changes would not matter much if
it weren't for one more change that we must also consider. This is
a change that is in some sense the most familiar, though its
significance and scope are not well understood. It is the one that
creates precisely the reason to be concerned about all the other
changes I have described.</p>
<p>This is the change in the concentration and integration of the
media. In the past twenty years, the nature of media ownership has
undergone a radical alteration, caused by changes in legal rules
governing the media. Before this change happened, the different
forms of media were owned by separate media companies. Now, the
media is increasingly owned by only a few companies. Indeed, after
the changes that the FCC announced in June 2003, most expect that
within a few years, we will live in a world where just three
companies control more than percent of the media.</p>
<p>These changes are of two sorts: the scope of concentration, and
its nature.</p>
<p>Changes in scope are the easier ones to describe. As Senator
John McCain summarized the data produced in the FCC's review of
media ownership, "five companies control 85 percent of our media
sources."<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_142" id=
"footnote_142_call">[142]</a> The five recording labels of
Universal Music Group, BMG, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music
Group, and EMI control 84.8 percent of the U.S. music
market.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_143" id=
"footnote_143_call">[143]</a> The "five largest cable companies
pipe programming to 74 percent of the cable subscribers
nationwide."<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_144"
id="footnote_144_call">[144]</a></p>
<p>The story with radio is even more dramatic. Before deregulation,
the nation's largest radio broadcasting conglomerate owned fewer
than seventy-five stations. Today one company owns more than 1,200
stations. During that period of consolidation, the total number of
radio owners dropped by 34 percent. Today, in most markets, the two
largest broadcasters control 74 percent of that market's revenues.
Overall, just four companies control 90 percent of the nation's
radio advertising revenues.</p>
<p>Newspaper ownership is becoming more concentrated as well.
Today, there are six hundred fewer daily newspapers in the United
States than there were eighty years ago, and ten companies control
half of the nation's circulation. There are twenty major newspaper
publishers in the United States. The top ten film studios receive
99 percent of all film revenue. The ten largest cable companies
account for 85 percent of all cable revenue. This is a market far
from the free press the framers sought to protect. Indeed, it is a
market that is quite well protected— by the market.</p>
<p>Concentration in size alone is one thing. The more invidious
change is in the nature of that concentration. As author James
Fallows put it in a recent article about Rupert Murdoch,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Murdoch's companies now constitute a production system unmatched
in its integration. They supply content—Fox movies&#160;… Fox TV
shows&#160;… Fox-controlled sports broadcasts, plus newspapers and
books. They sell the content to the public and to advertisers—in
newspapers, on the broadcast network, on the cable channels. And
they operate the physical distribution system through which the
content reaches the customers. Murdoch's satellite systems now
distribute News Corp. content in Europe and Asia; if Murdoch
becomes DirecTV's largest single owner, that system will serve the
same function in the United States.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_145" id="footnote_145_call">[145]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pattern with Murdoch is the pattern of modern media. Not
just large companies owning many radio stations, but a few
companies owning as many outlets of media as possible. A picture
describes this pattern better than a thousand words could do:</p>
<p>(Figure 5.19)</p>
<p>Does this concentration matter? Will it affect what is made, or
what is distributed? Or is it merely a more efficient way to
produce and distribute content?</p>
<p>My view was that concentration wouldn't matter. I thought it was
nothing more than a more efficient financial structure. But now,
after reading and listening to a barrage of creators try to
convince me to the contrary, I am beginning to change my mind.</p>
<p>Here's a representative story that begins to suggest how this
integration may matter.</p>
<p>In 1969, Norman Lear created a pilot for All in the Family. He
took the pilot to ABC. The network didn't like it. It was too edgy,
they told Lear. Make it again. Lear made a second pilot, more edgy
than the first. ABC was exasperated. You're missing the point, they
told Lear. We wanted less edgy, not more.</p>
<p>Rather than comply, Lear simply took the show elsewhere. CBS was
happy to have the series; ABC could not stop Lear from walking. The
copyrights that Lear held assured an independence from network
control.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_146" id=
"footnote_146_call">[146]</a></p>
<p>The network did not control those copyrights because the law
forbade the networks from controlling the content they syndicated.
The law required a separation between the networks and the content
producers; that separation would guarantee Lear freedom. And as
late as 1992, because of these rules, the vast majority of prime
time television—75 percent of it—was "independent" of the
networks.</p>
<p>In 1994, the FCC abandoned the rules that required this
independence. After that change, the networks quickly changed the
balance. In 1985, there were twenty-five independent television
production studios; in 2002, only five independent television
studios remained. "In 1992, only 15 percent of new series were
produced for a network by a company it controlled. Last year, the
percentage of shows produced by controlled companies more than
quintupled to 77 percent." "In 1992, 16 new series were produced
independently of conglomerate control, last year there was
one."<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_147" id=
"footnote_147_call">[147]</a> In 2002, 75 percent of prime time
television was owned by the networks that ran it. "In the ten-year
period between 1992 and 2002, the number of prime time television
hours per week produced by network studios increased over 200%,
whereas the number of prime time television hours per week produced
by independent studios decreased 63%."<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_148" id="footnote_148_call">[148]</a></p>
<p>Today, another Norman Lear with another All in the Family would
find that he had the choice either to make the show less edgy or to
be fired: The content of any show developed for a network is
increasingly owned by the network.</p>
<p>While the number of channels has increased dramatically, the
ownership of those channels has narrowed to an ever smaller and
smaller few. As Barry Diller said to Bill Moyers,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, if you have companies that produce, that finance, that air
on their channel and then distribute worldwide everything that goes
through their controlled distribution system, then what you get is
fewer and fewer actual voices participating in the process. [We
u]sed to have dozens and dozens of thriving independent production
companies producing television programs. Now you have less than a
handful.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_149" id=
"footnote_149_call">[149]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This narrowing has an effect on what is produced. The product of
such large and concentrated networks is increasingly homogenous.
Increasingly safe. Increasingly sterile. The product of news shows
from networks like this is increasingly tailored to the message the
network wants to convey. This is not the communist party, though
from the inside, it must feel a bit like the communist party. No
one can question without risk of consequence—not necessarily
banishment to Siberia, but punishment nonetheless. Independent,
critical, different views are quashed. This is not the environment
for a democracy.</p>
<p>Economics itself offers a parallel that explains why this
integration affects creativity. Clay Christensen has written about
the "Innovator's Dilemma": the fact that large traditional firms
find it rational to ignore new, breakthrough technologies that
compete with their core business. The same analysis could help
explain why large, traditional media companies would find it
rational to ignore new cultural trends.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_150" id="footnote_150_call">[150]</a>
Lumbering giants not only don't, but should not, sprint. Yet if the
field is only open to the giants, there will be far too little
sprinting.</p>
<p>I don't think we know enough about the economics of the media
market to say with certainty what concentration and integration
will do. The efficiencies are important, and the effect on culture
is hard to measure.</p>
<p>But there is a quintessentially obvious example that does
strongly suggest the concern.</p>
<p>In addition to the copyright wars, we're in the middle of the
drug wars. Government policy is strongly directed against the drug
cartels; criminal and civil courts are filled with the consequences
of this battle.</p>
<p>Let me hereby disqualify myself from any possible appointment to
any position in government by saying I believe this war is a
profound mistake. I am not pro drugs. Indeed, I come from a family
once wrecked by drugs—though the drugs that wrecked my family were
all quite legal. I believe this war is a profound mistake because
the collateral damage from it is so great as to make waging the war
insane. When you add together the burdens on the criminal justice
system, the desperation of generations of kids whose only real
economic opportunities are as drug warriors, the queering of
constitutional protections because of the constant surveillance
this war requires, and, most profoundly, the total destruction of
the legal systems of many South American nations because of the
power of the local drug cartels, I find it impossible to believe
that the marginal benefit in reduced drug consumption by Americans
could possibly outweigh these costs.</p>
<p>You may not be convinced. That's fine. We live in a democracy,
and it is through votes that we are to choose policy. But to do
that, we depend fundamentally upon the press to help inform
Americans about these issues.</p>
<p>Beginning in 1998, the Office of National Drug Control Policy
launched a media campaign as part of the "war on drugs." The
campaign produced scores of short film clips about issues related
to illegal drugs. In one series (the Nick and Norm series) two men
are in a bar, discussing the idea of legalizing drugs as a way to
avoid some of the collateral damage from the war. One advances an
argument in favor of drug legalization. The other responds in a
powerful and effective way against the argument of the first. In
the end, the first guy changes his mind (hey, it's television). The
plug at the end is a damning attack on the pro-legalization
campaign.</p>
<p>Fair enough. It's a good ad. Not terribly misleading. It
delivers its message well. It's a fair and reasonable message.</p>
<p>But let's say you think it is a wrong message, and you'd like to
run a countercommercial. Say you want to run a series of ads that
try to demonstrate the extraordinary collateral harm that comes
from the drug war. Can you do it?</p>
<p>Well, obviously, these ads cost lots of money. Assume you raise
the money. Assume a group of concerned citizens donates all the
money in the world to help you get your message out. Can you be
sure your message will be heard then?</p>
<p>No. You cannot. Television stations have a general policy of
avoiding "controversial" ads. Ads sponsored by the government are
deemed uncontroversial; ads disagreeing with the government are
controversial. This selectivity might be thought inconsistent with
the First Amendment, but the Supreme Court has held that stations
have the right to choose what they run. Thus, the major channels of
commercial media will refuse one side of a crucial debate the
opportunity to present its case. And the courts will defend the
rights of the stations to be this biased.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_151" id="footnote_151_call">[151]</a></p>
<p>I'd be happy to defend the networks' rights, as well—if we lived
in a media market that was truly diverse. But concentration in the
media throws that condition into doubt. If a handful of companies
control access to the media, and that handful of companies gets to
decide which political positions it will allow to be promoted on
its channels, then in an obvious and important way, concentration
matters. You might like the positions the handful of companies
selects. But you should not like a world in which a mere few get to
decide which issues the rest of us get to know about.</p>
