<div class="text">
<p>The key to the "piracy" that the law aims to quash is a use that
"rob[s] the author of [his] profit."<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_73" id="footnote_73_call">[73]</a> This
means we must determine whether and how much p2p sharing harms
before we know how strongly the law should seek to either prevent
it or find an alternative to assure the author of his profit.</p>
<p>Peer-to-peer sharing was made famous by Napster. But the
inventors of the Napster technology had not made any major
technological innovations. Like every great advance in innovation
on the Internet (and, arguably, off the Internet as well<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_74" id=
"footnote_74_call">[74]</a> ), Shawn Fanning and crew had simply
put together components that had been developed independently.</p>
<p>The result was spontaneous combustion. Launched in July 1999,
Napster amassed over 10 million users within nine months. After
eighteen months, there were close to 80 million registered users of
the system.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_75" id=
"footnote_75_call">[75]</a> Courts quickly shut Napster down, but
other services emerged to take its place. (Kazaa is currently the
most popular p2p service. It boasts over 100 million members.)
These services' systems are different architecturally, though not
very different in function: Each enables users to make content
available to any number of other users. With a p2p system, you can
share your favorite songs with your best friend— or your 20,000
best friends.</p>
<p>According to a number of estimates, a huge proportion of
Americans have tasted file-sharing technology. A study by
Ipsos-Insight in September 2002 estimated that 60 million Americans
had downloaded music—28 percent of Americans older than
12.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_76" id=
"footnote_76_call">[76]</a> A survey by the NPD group quoted in The
New York Times estimated that 43 million citizens used file-sharing
networks to exchange content in May 2003.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_77" id="footnote_77_call">[77]</a> The vast
majority of these are not kids. Whatever the actual figure, a
massive quantity of content is being "taken" on these networks. The
ease and inexpensiveness of file-sharing networks have inspired
millions to enjoy music in a way that they hadn't before.</p>
<p>Some of this enjoying involves copyright infringement. Some of
it does not. And even among the part that is technically copyright
infringement, calculating the actual harm to copyright owners is
more complicated than one might think. So consider—a bit more
carefully than the polarized voices around this debate usually
do—the kinds of sharing that file sharing enables, and the kinds of
harm it entails.</p>
<p>File sharers share different kinds of content. We can divide
these different kinds into four types.</p>
<p>A. There are some who use sharing networks as substitutes for
purchasing content. Thus, when a new Madonna CD is released, rather
than buying the CD, these users simply take it. We might quibble
about whether everyone who takes it would actually have bought it
if sharing didn't make it available for free. Most probably
wouldn't have, but clearly there are some who would. The latter are
the target of category A: users who download instead of
purchasing.</p>
<p>B. There are some who use sharing networks to sample music
before purchasing it. Thus, a friend sends another friend an MP3 of
an artist he's not heard of. The other friend then buys CDs by that
artist. This is a kind of targeted advertising, quite likely to
succeed. If the friend recommending the album gains nothing from a
bad recommendation, then one could expect that the recommendations
will actually be quite good. The net effect of this sharing could
increase the quantity of music purchased.</p>
<p>C. There are many who use sharing networks to get access to
copyrighted content that is no longer sold or that they would not
have purchased because the transaction costs off the Net are too
high. This use of sharing networks is among the most rewarding for
many. Songs that were part of your childhood but have long vanished
from the marketplace magically appear again on the network. (One
friend told me that when she discovered Napster, she spent a solid
weekend "recalling" old songs. She was astonished at the range and
mix of content that was available.) For content not sold, this is
still technically a violation of copyright, though because the
copyright owner is not selling the content anymore, the economic
harm is zero—the same harm that occurs when I sell my collection of
1960s 45-rpm records to a local collector.</p>
<p>D. Finally, there are many who use sharing networks to get
access to content that is not copyrighted or that the copyright
owner wants to give away.</p>
<p>How do these different types of sharing balance out?</p>
<p>Let's start with some simple but important points. From the
perspective of the law, only type D sharing is clearly legal. From
the perspective of economics, only type A sharing is clearly
harmful.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_78" id=
"footnote_78_call">[78]</a> Type B sharing is illegal but plainly
beneficial. Type C sharing is illegal, yet good for society (since
more exposure to music is good) and harmless to the artist (since
the work is not otherwise available). So how sharing matters on
balance is a hard question to answer—and certainly much more
difficult than the current rhetoric around the issue suggests.</p>
<p>Whether on balance sharing is harmful depends importantly on how
harmful type A sharing is. Just as Edison complained about
Hollywood, composers complained about piano rolls, recording
artists complained about radio, and broadcasters complained about
cable TV, the music industry complains that type A sharing is a
kind of "theft" that is "devastating" the industry.</p>
<p>While the numbers do suggest that sharing is harmful, how
harmful is harder to reckon. It has long been the recording
industry's practice to blame technology for any drop in sales. The
history of cassette recording is a good example. As a study by Cap
Gemini Ernst &amp; Young put it, "Rather than exploiting this new,
popular technology, the labels fought it."<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_79" id="footnote_79_call">[79]</a> The
labels claimed that every album taped was an album unsold, and when
record sales fell by 11.4 percent in 1981, the industry claimed
that its point was proved. Technology was the problem, and banning
or regulating technology was the answer.</p>
<p>Yet soon thereafter, and before Congress was given an
opportunity to enact regulation, MTV was launched, and the industry
had a record turnaround. "In the end," Cap Gemini concludes, "the
`crisis'&#160;… was not the fault of the tapers—who did not [stop
after MTV came into being]—but had to a large extent resulted from
stagnation in musical innovation at the major labels."<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_80" id=
"footnote_80_call">[80]</a></p>
<p>But just because the industry was wrong before does not mean it
is wrong today. To evaluate the real threat that p2p sharing
presents to the industry in particular, and society in general—or
at least the society that inherits the tradition that gave us the
film industry, the record industry, the radio industry, cable TV,
and the VCR—the question is not simply whether type A sharing is
harmful. The question is also how harmful type A sharing is, and
how beneficial the other types of sharing are.</p>
<p>We start to answer this question by focusing on the net harm,
from the standpoint of the industry as a whole, that sharing
networks cause. The "net harm" to the industry as a whole is the
amount by which type A sharing exceeds type B. If the record
companies sold more records through sampling than they lost through
substitution, then sharing networks would actually benefit music
companies on balance. They would therefore have little static
reason to resist them.</p>
<p>Could that be true? Could the industry as a whole be gaining
because of file sharing? Odd as that might sound, the data about CD
sales actually suggest it might be close.</p>
<p>In 2002, the RIAA reported that CD sales had fallen by 8.9
percent, from 882 million to 803 million units; revenues fell 6.7
percent.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_81" id=
"footnote_81_call">[81]</a> This confirms a trend over the past few
years. The RIAA blames Internet piracy for the trend, though there
are many other causes that could account for this drop. SoundScan,
for example, reports a more than 20 percent drop in the number of
CDs released since 1999. That no doubt accounts for some of the
decrease in sales. Rising prices could account for at least some of
the loss. "From 1999 to 2001, the average price of a CD rose 7.2
percent, from $13.04 to $14.19."<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_82" id="footnote_82_call">[82]</a>
Competition from other forms of media could also account for some
of the decline. As Jane Black of BusinessWeek notes, "The
soundtrack to the film High Fidelity has a list price of $18.98.
You could get the whole movie [on DVD] for $19.99."<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_83" id=
"footnote_83_call">[83]</a></p>
<p>But let's assume the RIAA is right, and all of the decline in CD
sales is because of Internet sharing. Here's the rub: In the same
period that the RIAA estimates that 803 million CDs were sold, the
RIAA estimates that 2.1 billion CDs were downloaded for free. Thus,
although 2.6 times the total number of CDs sold were downloaded for
free, sales revenue fell by just 6.7 percent.</p>
<p>There are too many different things happening at the same time
to explain these numbers definitively, but one conclusion is
unavoidable: The recording industry constantly asks, "What's the
difference between downloading a song and stealing a CD?"—but their
own numbers reveal the difference. If I steal a CD, then there is
one less CD to sell. Every taking is a lost sale. But on the basis
of the numbers the RIAA provides, it is absolutely clear that the
same is not true of downloads. If every download were a lost
sale—if every use of Kazaa "rob[bed] the author of [his]
profit"—then the industry would have suffered a 100 percent drop in
sales last year, not a 7 percent drop. If 2.6 times the number of
CDs sold were downloaded for free, and yet sales revenue dropped by
just 6.7 percent, then there is a huge difference between
"downloading a song and stealing a CD."</p>
<p>These are the harms—alleged and perhaps exaggerated but, let's
assume, real. What of the benefits? File sharing may impose costs
on the recording industry. What value does it produce in addition
to these costs?</p>
<p>One benefit is type C sharing—making available content that is
technically still under copyright but is no longer commercially
available. This is not a small category of content. There are
millions of tracks that are no longer commercially
available.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_84" id=
"footnote_84_call">[84]</a> And while it's conceivable that some of
this content is not available because the artist producing the
content doesn't want it to be made available, the vast majority of
it is unavailable solely because the publisher or the distributor
has decided it no longer makes economic sense to the company to
make it available.</p>
<p>In real space—long before the Internet—the market had a simple
response to this problem: used book and record stores. There are
thousands of used book and used record stores in America
today.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_85" id=
"footnote_85_call">[85]</a> These stores buy content from owners,
then sell the content they buy. And under American copyright law,
when they buy and sell this content, even if the content is still
under copyright, the copyright owner doesn't get a dime. Used book
and record stores are commercial entities; their owners make money
from the content they sell; but as with cable companies before
statutory licensing, they don't have to pay the copyright owner for
the content they sell.</p>
<p>Type C sharing, then, is very much like used book stores or used
record stores. It is different, of course, because the person
making the content available isn't making money from making the
content available. It is also different, of course, because in real
space, when I sell a record, I don't have it anymore, while in
cyberspace, when someone shares my 1949 recording of Bernstein's
"Two Love Songs," I still have it. That difference would matter
economically if the owner of the copyright were selling the record
in competition to my sharing. But we're talking about the class of
content that is not currently commercially available. The Internet
is making it available, through cooperative sharing, without
competing with the market.</p>
<p>It may well be, all things considered, that it would be better
if the copyright owner got something from this trade. But just
because it may well be better, it doesn't follow that it would be
good to ban used book stores. Or put differently, if you think that
type C sharing should be stopped, do you think that libraries and
used book stores should be shut as well?</p>
<p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, file-sharing networks
enable type D sharing to occur—the sharing of content that
copyright owners want to have shared or for which there is no
continuing copyright. This sharing clearly benefits authors and
society. Science fiction author Cory Doctorow, for example,
released his first novel, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, both
free on-line and in bookstores on the same day. His (and his
publisher's) thinking was that the on-line distribution would be a
great advertisement for the "real" book. People would read part
on-line, and then decide whether they liked the book or not. If
they liked it, they would be more likely to buy it. Doctorow's
content is type D content. If sharing networks enable his work to
be spread, then both he and society are better off. (Actually, much
better off: It is a great book!)</p>
<p>Likewise for work in the public domain: This sharing benefits
society with no legal harm to authors at all. If efforts to solve
the problem of type A sharing destroy the opportunity for type D
sharing, then we lose something important in order to protect type
A content.</p>
<p>The point throughout is this: While the recording industry
understandably says, "This is how much we've lost," we must also
ask, "How much has society gained from p2p sharing? What are the
efficiencies? What is the content that otherwise would be
unavailable?"</p>
<p>For unlike the piracy I described in the first section of this
chapter, much of the "piracy" that file sharing enables is plainly
legal and good. And like the piracy I described in chapter 4, much
of this piracy is motivated by a new way of spreading content
caused by changes in the technology of distribution. Thus,
consistent with the tradition that gave us Hollywood, radio, the
recording industry, and cable TV, the question we should be asking
about file sharing is how best to preserve its benefits while
minimizing (to the extent possible) the wrongful harm it causes
artists. The question is one of balance. The law should seek that
balance, and that balance will be found only with time.</p>
<p>"But isn't the war just a war against illegal sharing? Isn't the
target just what you call type A sharing?"</p>
<p>You would think. And we should hope. But so far, it is not. The
effect of the war purportedly on type A sharing alone has been felt
far beyond that one class of sharing. That much is obvious from the
Napster case itself. When Napster told the district court that it
had developed a technology to block the transfer of 99.4 percent of
identified infringing material, the district court told counsel for
Napster 99.4 percent was not good enough. Napster had to push the
infringements "down to zero."<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_86" id="footnote_86_call">[86]</a></p>
<p>If 99.4 percent is not good enough, then this is a war on
file-sharing technologies, not a war on copyright infringement.
There is no way to assure that a p2p system is used 100 percent of
the time in compliance with the law, any more than there is a way
to assure that 100 percent of VCRs or 100 percent of Xerox machines
or 100 percent of handguns are used in compliance with the law.
Zero tolerance means zero p2p. The court's ruling means that we as
a society must lose the benefits of p2p, even for the totally legal
and beneficial uses they serve, simply to assure that there are
zero copyright infringements caused by p2p.</p>
<p>Zero tolerance has not been our history. It has not produced the
content industry that we know today. The history of American law
has been a process of balance. As new technologies changed the way
content was distributed, the law adjusted, after some time, to the
new technology. In this adjustment, the law sought to ensure the
legitimate rights of creators while protecting innovation.
Sometimes this has meant more rights for creators. Sometimes
less.</p>
<p>So, as we've seen, when "mechanical reproduction" threatened the
interests of composers, Congress balanced the rights of composers
against the interests of the recording industry. It granted rights
to composers, but also to the recording artists: Composers were to
be paid, but at a price set by Congress. But when radio started
broadcasting the recordings made by these recording artists, and
they complained to Congress that their "creative property" was not
being respected (since the radio station did not have to pay them
for the creativity it broadcast), Congress rejected their claim. An
indirect benefit was enough.</p>
<p>Cable TV followed the pattern of record albums. When the courts
rejected the claim that cable broadcasters had to pay for the
content they rebroadcast, Congress responded by giving broadcasters
a right to compensation, but at a level set by the law. It likewise
gave cable companies the right to the content, so long as they paid
the statutory price.</p>
<p>This compromise, like the compromise affecting records and
player pianos, served two important goals—indeed, the two central
goals of any copyright legislation. First, the law assured that new
innovators would have the freedom to develop new ways to deliver
content. Second, the law assured that copyright holders would be
paid for the content that was distributed. One fear was that if
Congress simply required cable TV to pay copyright holders whatever
they demanded for their content, then copyright holders associated
with broadcasters would use their power to stifle this new
technology, cable. But if Congress had permitted cable to use
broadcasters' content for free, then it would have unfairly
subsidized cable. Thus Congress chose a path that would assure
compensation without giving the past (broadcasters) control over
the future (cable).</p>
<p>In the same year that Congress struck this balance, two major
producers and distributors of film content filed a lawsuit against
another technology, the video tape recorder (VTR, or as we refer to
them today, VCRs) that Sony had produced, the Betamax. Disney's and
Universal's claim against Sony was relatively simple: Sony produced
a device, Disney and Universal claimed, that enabled consumers to
engage in copyright infringement. Because the device that Sony
built had a "record" button, the device could be used to record
copyrighted movies and shows. Sony was therefore benefiting from
the copyright infringement of its customers. It should therefore,
Disney and Universal claimed, be partially liable for that
infringement.</p>
<p>There was something to Disney's and Universal's claim. Sony did
decide to design its machine to make it very simple to record
television shows. It could have built the machine to block or
inhibit any direct copying from a television broadcast. Or
possibly, it could have built the machine to copy only if there
were a special "copy me" signal on the line. It was clear that
there were many television shows that did not grant anyone
permission to copy. Indeed, if anyone had asked, no doubt the
majority of shows would not have authorized copying. And in the
face of this obvious preference, Sony could have designed its
system to minimize the opportunity for copyright infringement. It
did not, and for that, Disney and Universal wanted to hold it
responsible for the architecture it chose.</p>
<p>MPAA president Jack Valenti became the studios' most vocal
champion. Valenti called VCRs "tapeworms." He warned, "When there
are 20, 30, 40 million of these VCRs in the land, we will be
invaded by millions of `tapeworms,' eating away at the very heart
and essence of the most precious asset the copyright owner has, his
copyright."<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_87" id=
"footnote_87_call">[87]</a> "One does not have to be trained in
sophisticated marketing and creative judgment," he told Congress,
"to understand the devastation on the after-theater marketplace
caused by the hundreds of millions of tapings that will adversely
impact on the future of the creative community in this country. It
is simply a question of basic economics and plain common
sense."<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_88" id=
"footnote_88_call">[88]</a> Indeed, as surveys would later show,
percent of VCR owners had movie libraries of ten videos or
more<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_89" id=
"footnote_89_call">[89]</a> —a use the Court would later hold was
not "fair." By "allowing VCR owners to copy freely by the means of
an exemption from copyright infringement without creating a
mechanism to compensate copyright owners," Valenti testified,
Congress would "take from the owners the very essence of their
property: the exclusive right to control who may use their work,
that is, who may copy it and thereby profit from its
reproduction."<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_90"
id="footnote_90_call">[90]</a></p>
<p>It took eight years for this case to be resolved by the Supreme
Court. In the interim, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which
includes Hollywood in its jurisdiction—leading Judge Alex Kozinski,
who sits on that court, refers to it as the "Hollywood
Circuit"—held that Sony would be liable for the copyright
infringement made possible by its machines. Under the Ninth
Circuit's rule, this totally familiar technology—which Jack Valenti
had called "the Boston Strangler of the American film industry"
(worse yet, it was a Japanese Boston Strangler of the American film
industry)—was an illegal technology.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_91" id="footnote_91_call">[91]</a></p>
<p>But the Supreme Court reversed the decision of the Ninth
Circuit. And in its reversal, the Court clearly articulated its
understanding of when and whether courts should intervene in such
disputes. As the Court wrote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sound policy, as well as history, supports our consistent
deference to Congress when major technological innovations alter
the market for copyrighted materials. Congress has the
constitutional authority and the institutional ability to
accommodate fully the varied permutations of competing interests
that are inevitably implicated by such new technology.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_92" id=
"footnote_92_call">[92]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Congress was asked to respond to the Supreme Court's decision.
But as with the plea of recording artists about radio broadcasts,
Congress ignored the request. Congress was convinced that American
film got enough, this "taking" notwithstanding. If we put these
cases together, a pattern is clear:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>CASE</td>
<td>WHOSE VALUE WAS "PIRATED"</td>
<td>RESPONSE OF THE COURTS</td>
<td>RESPONSE OF CONGRESS</td>

<tr>

<td>Broadcasters</td>

</table>
<p>In each case throughout our history, a new technology changed
the way content was distributed.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_93" id="footnote_93_call">[93]</a> In each
case, throughout our history, that change meant that someone got a
"free ride" on someone else's work.</p>
<p>In none of these cases did either the courts or Congress
eliminate all free riding. In none of these cases did the courts or
Congress insist that the law should assure that the copyright
holder get all the value that his copyright created. In every case,
the copyright owners complained of "piracy." In every case,
Congress acted to recognize some of the legitimacy in the behavior
of the "pirates." In each case, Congress allowed some new
technology to benefit from content made before. It balanced the
interests at stake.</p>
<p>When you think across these examples, and the other examples
that make up the first four chapters of this section, this balance
makes sense. Was Walt Disney a pirate? Would doujinshi be better if
creators had to ask permission? Should tools that enable others to
capture and spread images as a way to cultivate or criticize our
culture be better regulated? Is it really right that building a
search engine should expose you to $15 million in damages? Would it
have been better if Edison had controlled film? Should every cover
band have to hire a lawyer to get permission to record a song?</p>
<p>We could answer yes to each of these questions, but our
tradition has answered no. In our tradition, as the Supreme Court
has stated, copyright "has never accorded the copyright owner
complete control over all possible uses of his work."<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_94" id=
"footnote_94_call">[94]</a> Instead, the particular uses that the
law regulates have been defined by balancing the good that comes
from granting an exclusive right against the burdens such an
exclusive right creates. And this balancing has historically been
done after a technology has matured, or settled into the mix of
technologies that facilitate the distribution of content.</p>
<p>We should be doing the same thing today. The technology of the
Internet is changing quickly. The way people connect to the
Internet (wires vs. wireless) is changing very quickly. No doubt
the network should not become a tool for "stealing" from artists.
But neither should the law become a tool to entrench one particular
way in which artists (or more accurately, distributors) get paid.
As I describe in some detail in the last chapter of this book, we
should be securing income to artists while we allow the market to
secure the most efficient way to promote and distribute content.
This will require changes in the law, at least in the interim.
These changes should be designed to balance the protection of the
law against the strong public interest that innovation
continue.</p>
<p>This is especially true when a new technology enables a vastly
superior mode of distribution. And this p2p has done. P2p
technologies can be ideally efficient in moving content across a
widely diverse network. Left to develop, they could make the
network vastly more efficient. Yet these "potential public
benefits," as John Schwartz writes in The New York Times, "could be
delayed in the P2P fight."<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_95" id="footnote_95_call">[95]</a> Yet when
anyone begins to talk about "balance," the copyright warriors raise
a different argument. "All this hand waving about balance and
incentives," they say, "misses a fundamental point. Our content,"
the warriors insist, "is our property. Why should we wait for
Congress to `rebalance' our property rights? Do you have to wait
before calling the police when your car has been stolen? And why
should Congress deliberate at all about the merits of this theft?
Do we ask whether the car thief had a good use for the car before
we arrest him?"</p>
<p>"It is our property," the warriors insist. "And it should be
protected just as any other property is protected."</p>
