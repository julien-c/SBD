"Piracy"</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>There is piracy of copyrighted material. Lots of it. This piracy
comes in many forms. The most significant is commercial piracy, the
unauthorized taking of other people's content within a commercial
context. Despite the many justifications that are offered in its
defense, this taking is wrong. No one should condone it, and the
law should stop it.</p>
<p>But as well as copy-shop piracy, there is another kind of
"taking" that is more directly related to the Internet. That
taking, too, seems wrong to many, and it is wrong much of the time.
Before we paint this taking "piracy," however, we should understand
its nature a bit more. For the harm of this taking is significantly
more ambiguous than outright copying, and the law should account
for that ambiguity, as it has so often done in the past.</p>
