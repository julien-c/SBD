Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind</em></a>
<p>In this enlightening book James Boyle describes what he calls
the range wars of the information age—today’s heated battles over
intellectual property. Boyle argues that just as every informed
citizen needs to know at least something about the environment or
civil rights, every citizen should also understand intellectual
property law. Why? Because intellectual property rights mark out
the ground rules of the information society, and today’s policies
are unbalanced, unsupported by evidence, and often detrimental to
cultural access, free speech, digital creativity, and scientific
innovation.<br />
Boyle identifies as a major problem the widespread failure to
understand the importance of the public domain—the realm of
material that everyone is free to use and share without permission
or fee. The public domain is as vital to innovation and culture as
the realm of material protected by intellectual property rights, he
asserts, and he calls for a movement akin to the environmental
movement to preserve it. With a clear analysis of issues ranging
from Jefferson’s philosophy of innovation to musical sampling,
synthetic biology and Internet file sharing, this timely book
brings a positive new perspective to important cultural and legal
debates. If we continue to enclose the “commons of the mind,” Boyle
argues, we will all be the poorer.</p>

Federalist Papers</em></a>
<p>The Federalist Papers are a series of 85 articles advocating the
ratification of the United States Constitution. Seventy-seven of
the essays were published serially in The Independent Journal and
The New York Packet between October 1787 and August 1788. A
compilation of these and eight others, called The Federalist, was
published in 1788 by J. and A. McLean.<br />
The Federalist Papers serve as a primary source for interpretation
of the Constitution, as they outline the philosophy and motivation
of the proposed system of government. The authors of the Federalist
Papers wanted to both influence the vote in favor of ratification
and shape future interpretations of the Constitution. According to
historian Richard B. Morris, they are an "incomparable exposition
of the Constitution, a classic in political science unsurpassed in
both breadth and depth by the product of any later American
writer."</p>

of War</em></a>
<p>The Art of War is a Chinese military treatise that was written
during the 6th century BC by Sun Tzu. Composed of 13 chapters, each
of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare, it has long been
praised as the definitive work on military strategies and tactics
of its time.<br />
The Art of War is one of the oldest books on military strategy in
the world. It is the first and one of the most successful works on
strategy and has had a huge influence on Eastern and Western
military thinking, business tactics, and beyond. Sun Tzu was the
first to recognize the importance of positioning in strategy and
that position is affected both by objective conditions in the
physical environment and the subjective opinions of competitive
actors in that environment. He taught that strategy was not
planning in the sense of working through a to-do list, but rather
that it requires quick and appropriate responses to changing
conditions. Planning works in a controlled environment, but in a
competitive environment,</p>

Selected Essays on Technology, Creativity, Copyright and the Future
of the Future</em></a>
<p>Hailed by Bruce Sterling as “a political activist, gizmo freak,
junk collector, programmer, entrepreneur, and all-around
Renaissance geek,” the Internet’s favorite high-tech culture maven
is celebrated with the first collection of his infamous articles,
essays, and polemics. Irreverently championing free speech and
universal access to information—even if it's just a free download
of the newest Britney Spears MP3—he leads off with a mutinous talk
given at Microsoft on digital rights management, insisting that
they stop treating their customers as criminals. Readers will
discover how America chose Happy Meal toys over copyright, why
Facebook is taking a faceplant, how the Internet is basically just
a giant Xerox machine, why Wikipedia is a poor cousin of The
Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, and how to enjoy free e-books.
Practicing what he preaches, all of the author's books, including
this one, are simultaneously released in print and on the Internet
under Creative Commons licenses that encourage their reuse and
sharing. He argues persuasively that this practice has considerably
increased his sales by enlisting readers to promote his work.
Accessible to geeks and nontechies alike, this is a timely
collection from an author who effortlessly surfs the zeitgeist
while always generating his own wave.</p>

Book of Tea</em></a>
<p>The Book of Tea was written by Okakura Kakuzo in the early 20th
century. It was first published in 1906, and has since been
republished many times.<br />
In the book, Kakuzo introduces the term Teaism and how Tea has
affected nearly every aspect of Japanese culture, thought, and
life. The book is accessibile to Western audiences because Kakuzo
was taught at a young age to speak English; and spoke it all his
life, becoming proficient at communicating his thoughts to the
Western Mind. In his book, he discusses such topics as Zen and
Taoism, but also the secular aspects of Tea and Japanese life. The
book emphasises how Teaism taught the Japanese many things; most
importantly, simplicity. Kakuzo argues that this tea-induced
simplicity affected art and architecture, and he was a long-time
student of the visual arts. He ends the book with a chapter on Tea
Masters, and spends some time talking about Sen no Rikyu and his
contribution to the Japanese Tea Ceremony.<br />
According to Tomonobu Imamichi, Heidegger's concept of Dasein in
Sein und Zeit was inspired — although Heidegger remains silent on
this — by Okakura Kakuzo's concept of das-in-dem-Welt-sein (to be
in the being of the world) expressed in The Book of Tea to describe
Zhuangzi's philosophy, which Imamichi's teacher had offerred to
Heidegger in 1919, after having followed lessons with him the year
before.</p>
