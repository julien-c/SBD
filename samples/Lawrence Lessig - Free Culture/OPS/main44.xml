<p>At least some who have read this far will agree with me that
something must be done to change where we are heading. The balance
of this book maps what might be done.</p>
<p>I divide this map into two parts: that which anyone can do now,
and that which requires the help of lawmakers. If there is one
lesson that we can draw from the history of remaking common sense,
it is that it requires remaking how many people think about the
very same issue.</p>
<p>That means this movement must begin in the streets. It must
recruit a significant number of parents, teachers, librarians,
creators, authors, musicians, filmmakers, scientistsâ€”all to tell
this story in their own words, and to tell their neighbors why this
battle is so important.</p>
<p>Once this movement has its effect in the streets, it has some
hope of having an effect in Washington. We are still a democracy.
What people think matters. Not as much as it should, at least when
an RCA stands opposed, but still, it matters. And thus, in the
second part below, I sketch changes that Congress could make to
better secure a free culture.</p>
