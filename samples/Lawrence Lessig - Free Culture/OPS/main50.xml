<h3 class="section_title">2. Registration and Renewal</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Under the old system, a copyright owner had to file a
registration with the Copyright Office to register or renew a
copyright. When filing that registration, the copyright owner paid
a fee. As with most government agencies, the Copyright Office had
little incentive to minimize the burden of registration; it also
had little incentive to minimize the fee. And as the Copyright
Office is not a main target of government policymaking, the office
has historically been terribly underfunded. Thus, when people who
know something about the process hear this idea about formalities,
their first reaction is panic—nothing could be worse than forcing
people to deal with the mess that is the Copyright Office.</p>
<p>Yet it is always astonishing to me that we, who come from a
tradition of extraordinary innovation in governmental design, can
no longer think innovatively about how governmental functions can
be designed. Just because there is a public purpose to a government
role, it doesn't follow that the government must actually
administer the role. Instead, we should be creating incentives for
private parties to serve the public, subject to standards that the
government sets.</p>
<p>In the context of registration, one obvious model is the
Internet. There are at least 32 million Web sites registered around
the world. Domain name owners for these Web sites have to pay a fee
to keep their registration alive. In the main top-level domains
(.com, .org, .net), there is a central registry. The actual
registrations are, however, performed by many competing registrars.
That competition drives the cost of registering down, and more
importantly, it drives the ease with which registration occurs
up.</p>
<p>We should adopt a similar model for the registration and renewal
of copyrights. The Copyright Office may well serve as the central
registry, but it should not be in the registrar business. Instead,
it should establish a database, and a set of standards for
registrars. It should approve registrars that meet its standards.
Those registrars would then compete with one another to deliver the
cheapest and simplest systems for registering and renewing
copyrights. That competition would substantially lower the burden
of this formality—while producing a database of registrations that
would facilitate the licensing of content.</p>
