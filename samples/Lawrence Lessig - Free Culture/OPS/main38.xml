<p>So here's the picture: You're standing at the side of the road.
Your car is on fire. You are angry and upset because in part you
helped start the fire. Now you don't know how to put it out. Next
to you is a bucket, filled with gasoline. Obviously, gasoline won't
put the fire out.</p>
<p>As you ponder the mess, someone else comes along. In a panic,
she grabs the bucket. Before you have a chance to tell her to
stop—or before she understands just why she should stop—the bucket
is in the air. The gasoline is about to hit the blazing car. And
the fire that gasoline will ignite is about to ignite everything
around.</p>
<p>A war about copyright rages all around—and we're all focusing on
the wrong thing. No doubt, current technologies threaten existing
businesses. No doubt they may threaten artists. But technologies
change. The industry and technologists have plenty of ways to use
technology to protect themselves against the current threats of the
Internet. This is a fire that if let alone would burn itself
out.</p>
<p>Yet policy makers are not willing to leave this fire to itself.
Primed with plenty of lobbyists' money, they are keen to intervene
to eliminate the problem they perceive. But the problem they
perceive is not the real threat this culture faces. For while we
watch this small fire in the corner, there is a massive change in
the way culture is made that is happening all around.</p>
<p>Somehow we have to find a way to turn attention to this more
important and fundamental issue. Somehow we have to find a way to
avoid pouring gasoline onto this fire.</p>
<p>We have not found that way yet. Instead, we seem trapped in a
simpler, binary view. However much many people push to frame this
debate more broadly, it is the simple, binary view that remains. We
rubberneck to look at the fire when we should be keeping our eyes
on the road.</p>
<p>This challenge has been my life these last few years. It has
also been my failure. In the two chapters that follow, I describe
one small brace of efforts, so far failed, to find a way to refocus
this debate. We must understand these failures if we're to
understand what success will require.</p>
