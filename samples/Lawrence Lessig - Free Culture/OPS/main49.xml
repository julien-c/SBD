<h3 class="section_title">1. More Formalities</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>If you buy a house, you have to record the sale in a deed. If
you buy land upon which to build a house, you have to record the
purchase in a deed. If you buy a car, you get a bill of sale and
register the car. If you buy an airplane ticket, it has your name
on it.</p>
<p>These are all formalities associated with property. They are
requirements that we all must bear if we want our property to be
protected.</p>
<p>In contrast, under current copyright law, you automatically get
a copyright, regardless of whether you comply with any formality.
You don't have to register. You don't even have to mark your
content. The default is control, and "formalities" are
banished.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>As I suggested in chapter 10, the motivation to abolish
formalities was a good one. In the world before digital
technologies, formalities imposed a burden on copyright holders
without much benefit. Thus, it was progress when the law relaxed
the formal requirements that a copyright owner must bear to protect
and secure his work. Those formalities were getting in the way.</p>
<p>But the Internet changes all this. Formalities today need not be
a burden. Rather, the world without formalities is the world that
burdens creativity. Today, there is no simple way to know who owns
what, or with whom one must deal in order to use or build upon the
creative work of others. There are no records, there is no system
to trace— there is no simple way to know how to get permission. Yet
given the massive increase in the scope of copyright's rule,
getting permission is a necessary step for any work that builds
upon our past. And thus, the lack of formalities forces many into
silence where they otherwise could speak.</p>
<p>The law should therefore change this requirement<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_212" id=
"footnote_212_call">[212]</a> —but it should not change it by going
back to the old, broken system. We should require formalities, but
we should establish a system that will create the incentives to
minimize the burden of these formalities.</p>
<p>The important formalities are three: marking copyrighted work,
registering copyrights, and renewing the claim to copyright.
Traditionally, the first of these three was something the copyright
owner did; the second two were something the government did. But a
revised system of formalities would banish the government from the
process, except for the sole purpose of approving standards
developed by others.</p>
