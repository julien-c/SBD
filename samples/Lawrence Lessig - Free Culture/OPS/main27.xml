<div class="text">
<p>Whereas originally the law regulated only publishers, the change
in copyright's scope means that the law today regulates publishers,
users, and authors. It regulates them because all three are capable
of making copies, and the core of the regulation of copyright law
is copies.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_133" id=
"footnote_133_call">[133]</a></p>
<p>"Copies." That certainly sounds like the obvious thing for
copyright law to regulate. But as with Jack Valenti's argument at
the start of this chapter, that "creative property" deserves the
"same rights" as all other property, it is the obvious that we need
to be most careful about. For while it may be obvious that in the
world before the Internet, copies were the obvious trigger for
copyright law, upon reflection, it should be obvious that in the
world with the Internet, copies should not be the trigger for
copyright law. More precisely, they should not always be the
trigger for copyright law.</p>
<p>This is perhaps the central claim of this book, so let me take
this very slowly so that the point is not easily missed. My claim
is that the Internet should at least force us to rethink the
conditions under which the law of copyright automatically
applies,<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_134" id=
"footnote_134_call">[134]</a> because it is clear that the current
reach of copyright was never contemplated, much less chosen, by the
legislators who enacted copyright law.</p>
<p>We can see this point abstractly by beginning with this largely
empty circle.</p>
<p>(Figure 5.7)</p>
<p>Think about a book in real space, and imagine this circle to
represent all its potential uses. Most of these uses are
unregulated by copyright law, because the uses don't create a copy.
If you read a book, that act is not regulated by copyright law. If
you give someone the book, that act is not regulated by copyright
law. If you resell a book, that act is not regulated (copyright law
expressly states that after the first sale of a book, the copyright
owner can impose no further conditions on the disposition of the
book). If you sleep on the book or use it to hold up a lamp or let
your puppy chew it up, those acts are not regulated by copyright
law, because those acts do not make a copy.</p>
<p>(Figure 5.8)</p>
<p>Obviously, however, some uses of a copyrighted book are
regulated by copyright law. Republishing the book, for example,
makes a copy. It is therefore regulated by copyright law. Indeed,
this particular use stands at the core of this circle of possible
uses of a copyrighted work. It is the paradigmatic use properly
regulated by copyright regulation (see first diagram on next
page).</p>
<p>Finally, there is a tiny sliver of otherwise regulated copying
uses that remain unregulated because the law considers these "fair
uses."</p>
<p>(Figure 5.9)</p>
<p>These are uses that themselves involve copying, but which the
law treats as unregulated because public policy demands that they
remain unregulated. You are free to quote from this book, even in a
review that is quite negative, without my permission, even though
that quoting makes a copy. That copy would ordinarily give the
copyright owner the exclusive right to say whether the copy is
allowed or not, but the law denies the owner any exclusive right
over such "fair uses" for public policy (and possibly First
Amendment) reasons.</p>
<p>(Figure 5.10)</p>
<p>(Figure 5.11)</p>
<p>In real space, then, the possible uses of a book are divided
into three sorts: (1) unregulated uses, (2) regulated uses, and (3)
regulated uses that are nonetheless deemed "fair" regardless of the
copyright owner's views.</p>
<p>Enter the Internet—a distributed, digital network where every
use of a copyrighted work produces a copy.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_135" id="footnote_135_call">[135]</a> And
because of this single, arbitrary feature of the design of a
digital network, the scope of category 1 changes dramatically. Uses
that before were presumptively unregulated are now presumptively
regulated. No longer is there a set of presumptively unregulated
uses that define a freedom associated with a copyrighted work.
Instead, each use is now subject to the copyright, because each use
also makes a copy—category 1 gets sucked into category 2. And those
who would defend the unregulated uses of copyrighted work must look
exclusively to category 3, fair uses, to bear the burden of this
shift.</p>
<p>So let's be very specific to make this general point clear.
Before the Internet, if you purchased a book and read it ten times,
there would be no plausible copyright-related argument that the
copyright owner could make to control that use of her book.
Copyright law would have nothing to say about whether you read the
book once, ten times, or every night before you went to bed. None
of those instances of use—reading— could be regulated by copyright
law because none of those uses produced a copy.</p>
<p>But the same book as an e-book is effectively governed by a
different set of rules. Now if the copyright owner says you may
read the book only once or only once a month, then copyright law
would aid the copyright owner in exercising this degree of control,
because of the accidental feature of copyright law that triggers
its application upon there being a copy. Now if you read the book
ten times and the license says you may read it only five times,
then whenever you read the book (or any portion of it) beyond the
fifth time, you are making a copy of the book contrary to the
copyright owner's wish.</p>
<p>There are some people who think this makes perfect sense. My aim
just now is not to argue about whether it makes sense or not. My
aim is only to make clear the change. Once you see this point, a
few other points also become clear:</p>
<p>First, making category 1 disappear is not anything any policy
maker ever intended. Congress did not think through the collapse of
the presumptively unregulated uses of copyrighted works. There is
no evidence at all that policy makers had this idea in mind when
they allowed our policy here to shift. Unregulated uses were an
important part of free culture before the Internet.</p>
<p>Second, this shift is especially troubling in the context of
transformative uses of creative content. Again, we can all
understand the wrong in commercial piracy. But the law now purports
to regulate any transformation you make of creative work using a
machine. "Copy and paste" and "cut and paste" become crimes.
Tinkering with a story and releasing it to others exposes the
tinkerer to at least a requirement of justification. However
troubling the expansion with respect to copying a particular work,
it is extraordinarily troubling with respect to transformative uses
of creative work.</p>
<p>Third, this shift from category 1 to category 2 puts an
extraordinary burden on category 3 ("fair use") that fair use never
before had to bear. If a copyright owner now tried to control how
many times I could read a book on-line, the natural response would
be to argue that this is a violation of my fair use rights. But
there has never been any litigation about whether I have a fair use
right to read, because before the Internet, reading did not trigger
the application of copyright law and hence the need for a fair use
defense. The right to read was effectively protected before because
reading was not regulated.</p>
<p>This point about fair use is totally ignored, even by advocates
for free culture. We have been cornered into arguing that our
rights depend upon fair use—never even addressing the earlier
question about the expansion in effective regulation. A thin
protection grounded in fair use makes sense when the vast majority
of uses are unregulated. But when everything becomes presumptively
regulated, then the protections of fair use are not enough.</p>
<p>The case of Video Pipeline is a good example. Video Pipeline was
in the business of making "trailer" advertisements for movies
available to video stores. The video stores displayed the trailers
as a way to sell videos. Video Pipeline got the trailers from the
film distributors, put the trailers on tape, and sold the tapes to
the retail stores.</p>
<p>The company did this for about fifteen years. Then, in 1997, it
began to think about the Internet as another way to distribute
these previews. The idea was to expand their "selling by sampling"
technique by giving on-line stores the same ability to enable
"browsing." Just as in a bookstore you can read a few pages of a
book before you buy the book, so, too, you would be able to sample
a bit from the movie on-line before you bought it.</p>
<p>In 1998, Video Pipeline informed Disney and other film
distributors that it intended to distribute the trailers through
the Internet (rather than sending the tapes) to distributors of
their videos. Two years later, Disney told Video Pipeline to stop.
The owner of Video Pipeline asked Disney to talk about the
matter—he had built a business on distributing this content as a
way to help sell Disney films; he had customers who depended upon
his delivering this content. Disney would agree to talk only if
Video Pipeline stopped the distribution immediately. Video Pipeline
thought it was within their "fair use" rights to distribute the
clips as they had. So they filed a lawsuit to ask the court to
declare that these rights were in fact their rights.</p>
<p>Disney countersued—for $100 million in damages. Those damages
were predicated upon a claim that Video Pipeline had "willfully
infringed" on Disney's copyright. When a court makes a finding of
willful infringement, it can award damages not on the basis of the
actual harm to the copyright owner, but on the basis of an amount
set in the statute. Because Video Pipeline had distributed seven
hundred clips of Disney movies to enable video stores to sell
copies of those movies, Disney was now suing Video Pipeline for
$100 million.</p>
<p>Disney has the right to control its property, of course. But the
video stores that were selling Disney's films also had some sort of
right to be able to sell the films that they had bought from
Disney. Disney's claim in court was that the stores were allowed to
sell the films and they were permitted to list the titles of the
films they were selling, but they were not allowed to show clips of
the films as a way of selling them without Disney's permission.</p>
<p>Now, you might think this is a close case, and I think the
courts would consider it a close case. My point here is to map the
change that gives Disney this power. Before the Internet, Disney
couldn't really control how people got access to their content.
Once a video was in the marketplace, the "first-sale doctrine"
would free the seller to use the video as he wished, including
showing portions of it in order to engender sales of the entire
movie video. But with the Internet, it becomes possible for Disney
to centralize control over access to this content. Because each use
of the Internet produces a copy, use on the Internet becomes
subject to the copyright owner's control. The technology expands
the scope of effective control, because the technology builds a
copy into every transaction.</p>
<p>No doubt, a potential is not yet an abuse, and so the potential
for control is not yet the abuse of control. Barnes &amp; Noble has
the right to say you can't touch a book in their store; property
law gives them that right. But the market effectively protects
against that abuse. If Barnes &amp; Noble banned browsing, then
consumers would choose other bookstores. Competition protects
against the extremes. And it may well be (my argument so far does
not even question this) that competition would prevent any similar
danger when it comes to copyright. Sure, publishers exercising the
rights that authors have assigned to them might try to regulate how
many times you read a book, or try to stop you from sharing the
book with anyone. But in a competitive market such as the book
market, the dangers of this happening are quite slight.</p>
<p>Again, my aim so far is simply to map the changes that this
changed architecture enables. Enabling technology to enforce the
control of copyright means that the control of copyright is no
longer defined by balanced policy. The control of copyright is
simply what private owners choose. In some contexts, at least, that
fact is harmless. But in some contexts it is a recipe for
disaster.</p>
