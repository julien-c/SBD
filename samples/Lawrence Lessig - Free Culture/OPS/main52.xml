<h3 class="section_title">4. Shorter Terms</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The term of copyright has gone from fourteen years to
ninety-five years for corporate authors, and life of the author
plus seventy years for natural authors.</p>
<p>In The Future of Ideas, I proposed a seventy-five-year term,
granted in five-year increments with a requirement of renewal every
five years. That seemed radical enough at the time. But after we
lost Eldred v. Ashcroft, the proposals became even more radical.
The Economist endorsed a proposal for a fourteen-year copyright
term.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_214" id=
"footnote_214_call">[214]</a> Others have proposed tying the term
to the term for patents.</p>
<p>I agree with those who believe that we need a radical change in
copyright's term. But whether fourteen years or seventy-five, there
are four principles that are important to keep in mind about
copyright terms.</p>
<p>1. Keep it short: The term should be as long as necessary to
give incentives to create, but no longer. If it were tied to very
strong protections for authors (so authors were able to reclaim
rights from publishers), rights to the same work (not derivative
works) might be extended further. The key is not to tie the work up
with legal regulations when it no longer benefits an author.</p>
<p>2. Keep it simple: The line between the public domain and
protected content must be kept clear. Lawyers like the fuzziness of
"fair use," and the distinction between "ideas" and "expression."
That kind of law gives them lots of work. But our framers had a
simpler idea in mind: protected versus unprotected. The value of
short terms is that there is little need to build exceptions into
copyright when the term itself is kept short. A clear and active
"lawyer-free zone" makes the complexities of "fair use" and
"idea/expression" less necessary to navigate.</p>
<p>Keep it alive: Copyright should have to be renewed. Especially
if the maximum term is long, the copyright owner should be required
to signal periodically that he wants the protection continued. This
need not be an onerous burden, but there is no reason this monopoly
protection has to be granted for free. On average, it takes ninety
minutes for a veteran to apply for a pension.<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_215" id=
"footnote_215_call">[215]</a></p>
<p>If we make veterans suffer that burden, I don't see why we
couldn't require authors to spend ten minutes every fifty years to
file a single form.</p>
<p>3. Keep it prospective: Whatever the term of copyright should
be, the clearest lesson that economists teach is that a term once
given should not be extended. It might have been a mistake in 1923
for the law to offer authors only a fifty-six-year term. I don't
think so, but it's possible. If it was a mistake, then the
consequence was that we got fewer authors to create in 1923 than we
otherwise would have. But we can't correct that mistake today by
increasing the term. No matter what we do today, we will not
increase the number of authors who wrote in 1923. Of course, we can
increase the reward that those who write now get (or alternatively,
increase the copyright burden that smothers many works that are
today invisible). But increasing their reward will not increase
their creativity in 1923. What's not done is not done, and there's
nothing we can do about that now.</p>
<p>These changes together should produce an average copyright term
that is much shorter than the current term. Until 1976, the average
term was just 32.2 years. We should be aiming for the same.</p>
<p>No doubt the extremists will call these ideas "radical." (After
all, I call them "extremists.") But again, the term I recommended
was longer than the term under Richard Nixon. How "radical" can it
be to ask for a more generous copyright law than Richard Nixon
presided over?</p>
