<h3 class="section_title">1. Constraining Creators</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>In the next ten years we will see an explosion of digital
technologies. These technologies will enable almost anyone to
capture and share content. Capturing and sharing content, of
course, is what humans have done since the dawn of man. It is how
we learn and communicate. But capturing and sharing through digital
technology is different. The fidelity and power are different. You
could send an e-mail telling someone about a joke you saw on Comedy
Central, or you could send the clip. You could write an essay about
the inconsistencies in the arguments of the politician you most
love to hate, or you could make a short film that puts statement
against statement. You could write a poem to express your love, or
you could weave together a string—a mash-up— of songs from your
favorite artists in a collage and make it available on the Net.</p>
<p>This digital "capturing and sharing" is in part an extension of
the capturing and sharing that has always been integral to our
culture, and in part it is something new. It is continuous with the
Kodak, but it explodes the boundaries of Kodak-like technologies.
The technology of digital "capturing and sharing" promises a world
of extraordinarily diverse creativity that can be easily and
broadly shared. And as that creativity is applied to democracy, it
will enable a broad range of citizens to use technology to express
and criticize and contribute to the culture all around.</p>
<p>Technology has thus given us an opportunity to do something with
culture that has only ever been possible for individuals in small
groups, isolated from others. Think about an old man telling a
story to a collection of neighbors in a small town. Now imagine
that same storytelling extended across the globe.</p>
<p>Yet all this is possible only if the activity is presumptively
legal. In the current regime of legal regulation, it is not. Forget
file sharing for a moment. Think about your favorite amazing sites
on the Net. Web sites that offer plot summaries from forgotten
television shows; sites that catalog cartoons from the 1960s; sites
that mix images and sound to criticize politicians or businesses;
sites that gather newspaper articles on remote topics of science or
culture. There is a vast amount of creative work spread across the
Internet. But as the law is currently crafted, this work is
presumptively illegal.</p>
<p>That presumption will increasingly chill creativity, as the
examples of extreme penalties for vague infringements continue to
proliferate. It is impossible to get a clear sense of what's
allowed and what's not, and at the same time, the penalties for
crossing the line are astonishingly harsh. The four students who
were threatened by the RIAA ( Jesse Jordan of chapter 3 was just
one) were threatened with a $98 billion lawsuit for building search
engines that permitted songs to be copied. Yet World-Com—which
defrauded investors of $11 billion, resulting in a loss to
investors in market capitalization of over $200 billion—received a
fine of a mere $750 million.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_157" id="footnote_157_call">[157]</a> And
under legislation being pushed in Congress right now, a doctor who
negligently removes the wrong leg in an operation would be liable
for no more than $250,000 in damages for pain and
suffering.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_158" id=
"footnote_158_call">[158]</a> Can common sense recognize the
absurdity in a world where the maximum fine for downloading two
songs off the Internet is more than the fine for a doctor's
negligently butchering a patient?</p>
<p>The consequence of this legal uncertainty, tied to these
extremely high penalties, is that an extraordinary amount of
creativity will either never be exercised, or never be exercised in
the open. We drive this creative process underground by branding
the modern-day Walt Disneys "pirates." We make it impossible for
businesses to rely upon a public domain, because the boundaries of
the public domain are designed to be unclear. It never pays to do
anything except pay for the right to create, and hence only those
who can pay are allowed to create. As was the case in the Soviet
Union, though for very different reasons, we will begin to see a
world of underground art—not because the message is necessarily
political, or because the subject is controversial, but because the
very act of creating the art is legally fraught. Already, exhibits
of "illegal art" tour the United States.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_159" id="footnote_159_call">[159]</a> In
what does their "illegality" consist? In the act of mixing the
culture around us with an expression that is critical or
reflective.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for this fear of illegality has to do with
the changing law. I described that change in detail in chapter 10.
But an even bigger part has to do with the increasing ease with
which infractions can be tracked. As users of file-sharing systems
discovered in 2002, it is a trivial matter for copyright owners to
get courts to order Internet service providers to reveal who has
what content. It is as if your cassette tape player transmitted a
list of the songs that you played in the privacy of your own home
that anyone could tune into for whatever reason they chose.</p>
<p>Never in our history has a painter had to worry about whether
his painting infringed on someone else's work; but the modern-day
painter, using the tools of Photoshop, sharing content on the Web,
must worry all the time. Images are all around, but the only safe
images to use in the act of creation are those purchased from
Corbis or another image farm. And in purchasing, censoring happens.
There is a free market in pencils; we needn't worry about its
effect on creativity. But there is a highly regulated, monopolized
market in cultural icons; the right to cultivate and transform them
is not similarly free.</p>
<p>Lawyers rarely see this because lawyers are rarely empirical. As
I described in chapter 7, in response to the story about
documentary filmmaker Jon Else, I have been lectured again and
again by lawyers who insist Else's use was fair use, and hence I am
wrong to say that the law regulates such a use.</p>
<p>But fair use in America simply means the right to hire a lawyer
to defend your right to create. And as lawyers love to forget, our
system for defending rights such as fair use is astonishingly
bad—in practically every context, but especially here. It costs too
much, it delivers too slowly, and what it delivers often has little
connection to the justice underlying the claim. The legal system
may be tolerable for the very rich. For everyone else, it is an
embarrassment to a tradition that prides itself on the rule of
law.</p>
<p>Judges and lawyers can tell themselves that fair use provides
adequate "breathing room" between regulation by the law and the
access the law should allow. But it is a measure of how out of
touch our legal system has become that anyone actually believes
this. The rules that publishers impose upon writers, the rules that
film distributors impose upon filmmakers, the rules that newspapers
impose upon journalists— these are the real laws governing
creativity. And these rules have little relationship to the "law"
with which judges comfort themselves.</p>
<p>For in a world that threatens $150,000 for a single willful
infringement of a copyright, and which demands tens of thousands of
dollars to even defend against a copyright infringement claim, and
which would never return to the wrongfully accused defendant
anything of the costs she suffered to defend her right to speak—in
that world, the astonishingly broad regulations that pass under the
name "copyright" silence speech and creativity. And in that world,
it takes a studied blindness for people to continue to believe they
live in a culture that is free.</p>
<p>As Jed Horovitz, the businessman behind Video Pipeline, said to
me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We're losing [creative] opportunities right and left. Creative
people are being forced not to express themselves. Thoughts are not
being expressed. And while a lot of stuff may [still] be created,
it still won't get distributed. Even if the stuff gets made&#160;…
you're not going to get it distributed in the mainstream media
unless you've got a little note from a lawyer saying, "This has
been cleared." You're not even going to get it on PBS without that
kind of permission. That's the point at which they control it.</p>
