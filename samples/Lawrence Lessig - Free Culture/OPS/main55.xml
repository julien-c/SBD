<h3 class="section_title">7. Fire Lots of Lawyers</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>I'm a lawyer. I make lawyers for a living. I believe in the law.
I believe in the law of copyright. Indeed, I have devoted my life
to working in law, not because there are big bucks at the end but
because there are ideals at the end that I would love to live.</p>
<p>Yet much of this book has been a criticism of lawyers, or the
role lawyers have played in this debate. The law speaks to ideals,
but it is my view that our profession has become too attuned to the
client. And in a world where the rich clients have one strong view,
the unwillingness of the profession to question or counter that one
strong view queers the law.</p>
<p>The evidence of this bending is compelling. I'm attacked as a
"radical" by many within the profession, yet the positions that I
am advocating are precisely the positions of some of the most
moderate and significant figures in the history of this branch of
the law. Many, for example, thought crazy the challenge that we
brought to the Copyright Term Extension Act. Yet just thirty years
ago, the dominant scholar and practitioner in the field of
copyright, Melville Nimmer, thought it obvious.<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_221" id=
"footnote_221_call">[221]</a></p>
<p>However, my criticism of the role that lawyers have played in
this debate is not just about a professional bias. It is more
importantly about our failure to actually reckon the costs of the
law.</p>
<p>Economists are supposed to be good at reckoning costs and
benefits. But more often than not, economists, with no clue about
how the legal system actually functions, simply assume that the
transaction costs of the legal system are slight.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_222" id=
"footnote_222_call">[222]</a> They see a system that has been
around for hundreds of years, and they assume it works the way
their elementary school civics class taught them it works.</p>
<p>But the legal system doesn't work. Or more accurately, it
doesn't work for anyone except those with the most resources. Not
because the system is corrupt. I don't think our legal system (at
the federal level, at least) is at all corrupt. I mean simply
because the costs of our legal system are so astonishingly high
that justice can practically never be done.</p>
<p>These costs distort free culture in many ways. A lawyer's time
is billed at the largest firms at more than $400 per hour. How much
time should such a lawyer spend reading cases carefully, or
researching obscure strands of authority? The answer is the
increasing reality: very little. The law depended upon the careful
articulation and development of doctrine, but the careful
articulation and development of legal doctrine depends upon careful
work. Yet that careful work costs too much, except in the most
high-profile and costly cases.</p>
<p>The costliness and clumsiness and randomness of this system mock
our tradition. And lawyers, as well as academics, should consider
it their duty to change the way the law works—or better, to change
the law so that it works. It is wrong that the system works well
only for the top 1 percent of the clients. It could be made
radically more efficient, and inexpensive, and hence radically more
just.</p>
<p>But until that reform is complete, we as a society should keep
the law away from areas that we know it will only harm. And that is
precisely what the law will too often do if too much of our culture
is left to its review.</p>
<p>Think about the amazing things your kid could do or make with
digital technology—the film, the music, the Web page, the blog. Or
think about the amazing things your community could facilitate with
digital technology—a wiki, a barn raising, activism to change
something. Think about all those creative things, and then imagine
cold molasses poured onto the machines. This is what any regime
that requires permission produces. Again, this is the reality of
Brezhnev's Russia.</p>
<p>The law should regulate in certain areas of culture—but it
should regulate culture only where that regulation does good. Yet
lawyers rarely test their power, or the power they promote, against
this simple pragmatic question: "Will it do good?" When challenged
about the expanding reach of the law, the lawyer answers, "Why
not?"</p>
<p>We should ask, "Why?" Show me why your regulation of culture is
needed. Show me how it does good. And until you can show me both,
keep your lawyers away.</p>
