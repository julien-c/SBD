<h3 class="section_title">3. Corrupting Citizens</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>Overregulation stifles creativity. It smothers innovation. It
gives dinosaurs a veto over the future. It wastes the extraordinary
opportunity for a democratic creativity that digital technology
enables.</p>
<p>In addition to these important harms, there is one more that was
important to our forebears, but seems forgotten today.
Overregulation corrupts citizens and weakens the rule of law.</p>
<p>The war that is being waged today is a war of prohibition. As
with every war of prohibition, it is targeted against the behavior
of a very large number of citizens. According to The New York
Times, 43 million Americans downloaded music in May 2002.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_171" id=
"footnote_171_call">[171]</a> According to the RIAA, the behavior
of those 43 million Americans is a felony. We thus have a set of
rules that transform 20 percent of America into criminals. As the
RIAA launches lawsuits against not only the Napsters and Kazaas of
the world, but against students building search engines, and
increasingly against ordinary users downloading content, the
technologies for sharing will advance to further protect and hide
illegal use. It is an arms race or a civil war, with the extremes
of one side inviting a more extreme response by the other.</p>
<p>The content industry's tactics exploit the failings of the
American legal system. When the RIAA brought suit against Jesse
Jordan, it knew that in Jordan it had found a scapegoat, not a
defendant. The threat of having to pay either all the money in the
world in damages ($15,000,000) or almost all the money in the world
to defend against paying all the money in the world in damages
($250,000 in legal fees) led Jordan to choose to pay all the money
he had in the world ($12,000) to make the suit go away. The same
strategy animates the RIAA's suits against individual users. In
September 2003, the RIAA sued 261 individuals—including a
twelve-year-old girl living in public housing and a
seventy-year-old man who had no idea what file sharing
was.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_172" id=
"footnote_172_call">[172]</a> As these scapegoats discovered, it
will always cost more to defend against these suits than it would
cost to simply settle. (The twelve year old, for example, like
Jesse Jordan, paid her life savings of $2,000 to settle the case.)
Our law is an awful system for defending rights. It is an
embarrassment to our tradition. And the consequence of our law as
it is, is that those with the power can use the law to quash any
rights they oppose.</p>
<p>Wars of prohibition are nothing new in America. This one is just
something more extreme than anything we've seen before. We
experimented with alcohol prohibition, at a time when the per
capita consumption of alcohol was 1.5 gallons per capita per year.
The war against drinking initially reduced that consumption to just
30 percent of its preprohibition levels, but by the end of
prohibition, consumption was up to 70 percent of the preprohibition
level. Americans were drinking just about as much, but now, a vast
number were criminals.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_173" id="footnote_173_call">[173]</a> We
have launched a war on drugs aimed at reducing the consumption of
regulated narcotics that 7 percent (or 16 million) Americans now
use.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_174" id=
"footnote_174_call">[174]</a> That is a drop from the high (so to
speak) in 1979 of 14 percent of the population. We regulate
automobiles to the point where the vast majority of Americans
violate the law every day. We run such a complex tax system that a
majority of cash businesses regularly cheat.<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_175" id="footnote_175_call">[175]</a>
We pride ourselves on our "free society," but an endless array of
ordinary behavior is regulated within our society. And as a result,
a huge proportion of Americans regularly violate at least some
law.</p>
<p>This state of affairs is not without consequence. It is a
particularly salient issue for teachers like me, whose job it is to
teach law students about the importance of "ethics." As my
colleague Charlie Nesson told a class at Stanford, each year law
schools admit thousands of students who have illegally downloaded
music, illegally consumed alcohol and sometimes drugs, illegally
worked without paying taxes, illegally driven cars. These are kids
for whom behaving illegally is increasingly the norm. And then we,
as law professors, are supposed to teach them how to behave
ethically—how to say no to bribes, or keep client funds separate,
or honor a demand to disclose a document that will mean that your
case is over. Generations of Americans—more significantly in some
parts of America than in others, but still, everywhere in America
today—can't live their lives both normally and legally, since
"normally" entails a certain degree of illegality.</p>
<p>The response to this general illegality is either to enforce the
law more severely or to change the law. We, as a society, have to
learn how to make that choice more rationally. Whether a law makes
sense depends, in part, at least, upon whether the costs of the
law, both intended and collateral, outweigh the benefits. If the
costs, intended and collateral, do outweigh the benefits, then the
law ought to be changed. Alternatively, if the costs of the
existing system are much greater than the costs of an alternative,
then we have a good reason to consider the alternative.</p>
<p>My point is not the idiotic one: Just because people violate a
law, we should therefore repeal it. Obviously, we could reduce
murder statistics dramatically by legalizing murder on Wednesdays
and Fridays. But that wouldn't make any sense, since murder is
wrong every day of the week. A society is right to ban murder
always and everywhere.</p>
<p>My point is instead one that democracies understood for
generations, but that we recently have learned to forget. The rule
of law depends upon people obeying the law. The more often, and
more repeatedly, we as citizens experience violating the law, the
less we respect the law. Obviously, in most cases, the important
issue is the law, not respect for the law. I don't care whether the
rapist respects the law or not; I want to catch and incarcerate the
rapist. But I do care whether my students respect the law. And I do
care if the rules of law sow increasing disrespect because of the
extreme of regulation they impose. Twenty million Americans have
come of age since the Internet introduced this different idea of
"sharing." We need to be able to call these twenty million
Americans "citizens," not "felons."</p>
<p>When at least forty-three million citizens download content from
the Internet, and when they use tools to combine that content in
ways unauthorized by copyright holders, the first question we
should be asking is not how best to involve the FBI. The first
question should be whether this particular prohibition is really
necessary in order to achieve the proper ends that copyright law
serves. Is there another way to assure that artists get paid
without transforming forty-three million Americans into felons?
Does it make sense if there are other ways to assure that artists
get paid without transforming America into a nation of felons?</p>
<p>This abstract point can be made more clear with a particular
example.</p>
<p>We all own CDs. Many of us still own phonograph records. These
pieces of plastic encode music that in a certain sense we have
bought. The law protects our right to buy and sell that plastic: It
is not a copyright infringement for me to sell all my classical
records at a used record store and buy jazz records to replace
them. That "use" of the recordings is free.</p>
<p>But as the MP3 craze has demonstrated, there is another use of
phonograph records that is effectively free. Because these
recordings were made without copy-protection technologies, I am
"free" to copy, or "rip," music from my records onto a computer
hard disk. Indeed, Apple Corporation went so far as to suggest that
"freedom" was a right: In a series of commercials, Apple endorsed
the "Rip, Mix, Burn" capacities of digital technologies.</p>
<p>This "use" of my records is certainly valuable. I have begun a
large process at home of ripping all of my and my wife's CDs, and
storing them in one archive. Then, using Apple's iTunes, or a
wonderful program called Andromeda, we can build different play
lists of our music: Bach, Baroque, Love Songs, Love Songs of
Significant Others—the potential is endless. And by reducing the
costs of mixing play lists, these technologies help build a
creativity with play lists that is itself independently valuable.
Compilations of songs are creative and meaningful in their own
right.</p>
<p>This use is enabled by unprotected media—either CDs or records.
But unprotected media also enable file sharing. File sharing
threatens (or so the content industry believes) the ability of
creators to earn a fair return from their creativity. And thus,
many are beginning to experiment with technologies to eliminate
unprotected media. These technologies, for example, would enable
CDs that could not be ripped. Or they might enable spy programs to
identify ripped content on people's machines.</p>
<p>If these technologies took off, then the building of large
archives of your own music would become quite difficult. You might
hang in hacker circles, and get technology to disable the
technologies that protect the content. Trading in those
technologies is illegal, but maybe that doesn't bother you much. In
any case, for the vast majority of people, these protection
technologies would effectively destroy the archiving use of CDs.
The technology, in other words, would force us all back to the
world where we either listened to music by manipulating pieces of
plastic or were part of a massively complex "digital rights
management" system.</p>
<p>If the only way to assure that artists get paid were the
elimination of the ability to freely move content, then these
technologies to interfere with the freedom to move content would be
justifiable. But what if there were another way to assure that
artists are paid, without locking down any content? What if, in
other words, a different system could assure compensation to
artists while also preserving the freedom to move content
easily?</p>
<p>My point just now is not to prove that there is such a system. I
offer a version of such a system in the last chapter of this book.
For now, the only point is the relatively uncontroversial one: If a
different system achieved the same legitimate objectives that the
existing copyright system achieved, but left consumers and creators
much more free, then we'd have a very good reason to pursue this
alternative—namely, freedom. The choice, in other words, would not
be between property and piracy; the choice would be between
different property systems and the freedoms each allowed.</p>
<p>I believe there is a way to assure that artists are paid without
turning forty-three million Americans into felons. But the salient
feature of this alternative is that it would lead to a very
different market for producing and distributing creativity. The
dominant few, who today control the vast majority of the
distribution of content in the world, would no longer exercise this
extreme of control. Rather, they would go the way of the
horse-drawn buggy.</p>
<p>Except that this generation's buggy manufacturers have already
saddled Congress, and are riding the law to protect themselves
against this new form of competition. For them the choice is
between fortythree million Americans as criminals and their own
survival.</p>
<p>It is understandable why they choose as they do. It is not
understandable why we as a democracy continue to choose as we do.
Jack Valenti is charming; but not so charming as to justify giving
up a tradition as deep and important as our tradition of free
culture. There's one more aspect to this corruption that is
particularly important to civil liberties, and follows directly
from any war of prohibition. As Electronic Frontier Foundation
attorney Fred von Lohmann describes, this is the "collateral
damage" that "arises whenever you turn a very large percentage of
the population into criminals." This is the collateral damage to
civil liberties generally.</p>
<p>"If you can treat someone as a putative lawbreaker," von Lohmann
explains,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>then all of a sudden a lot of basic civil liberty protections
evaporate to one degree or another… . If you're a copyright
infringer, how can you hope to have any privacy rights? If you're a
copyright infringer, how can you hope to be secure against seizures
of your computer? How can you hope to continue to receive Internet
access?&#160;… Our sensibilities change as soon as we think, "Oh,
well, but that person's a criminal, a lawbreaker." Well, what this
campaign against file sharing has done is turn a remarkable
percentage of the American Internet-using population into
"lawbreakers."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the consequence of this transformation of the American
public into criminals is that it becomes trivial, as a matter of
due process, to effectively erase much of the privacy most would
presume.</p>
<p>Users of the Internet began to see this generally in 2003 as the
RIAA launched its campaign to force Internet service providers to
turn over the names of customers who the RIAA believed were
violating copyright law. Verizon fought that demand and lost. With
a simple request to a judge, and without any notice to the customer
at all, the identity of an Internet user is revealed.</p>
<p>The RIAA then expanded this campaign, by announcing a general
strategy to sue individual users of the Internet who are alleged to
have downloaded copyrighted music from file-sharing systems. But as
we've seen, the potential damages from these suits are
astronomical: If a family's computer is used to download a single
CD's worth of music, the family could be liable for $2 million in
damages. That didn't stop the RIAA from suing a number of these
families, just as they had sued Jesse Jordan.<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_176" id=
"footnote_176_call">[176]</a></p>
<p>Even this understates the espionage that is being waged by the
RIAA. A report from CNN late last summer described a strategy the
RIAA had adopted to track Napster users.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_177" id="footnote_177_call">[177]</a> Using
a sophisticated hashing algorithm, the RIAA took what is in effect
a fingerprint of every song in the Napster catalog. Any copy of one
of those MP3s will have the same "fingerprint."</p>
<p>So imagine the following not-implausible scenario: Imagine a
friend gives a CD to your daughter—a collection of songs just like
the cassettes you used to make as a kid. You don't know, and
neither does your daughter, where these songs came from. But she
copies these songs onto her computer. She then takes her computer
to college and connects it to a college network, and if the college
network is "cooperating" with the RIAA's espionage, and she hasn't
properly protected her content from the network (do you know how to
do that yourself&#160;?), then the RIAA will be able to identify
your daughter as a "criminal." And under the rules that
universities are beginning to deploy,<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_178" id="footnote_178_call">[178]</a> your
daughter can lose the right to use the university's computer
network. She can, in some cases, be expelled.</p>
<p>Now, of course, she'll have the right to defend herself. You can
hire a lawyer for her (at $300 per hour, if you're lucky), and she
can plead that she didn't know anything about the source of the
songs or that they came from Napster. And it may well be that the
university believes her. But the university might not believe her.
It might treat this "contraband" as presumptive of guilt. And as
any number of college students have already learned, our
presumptions about innocence disappear in the middle of wars of
prohibition. This war is no different. Says von Lohmann,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So when we're talking about numbers like forty to sixty million
Americans that are essentially copyright infringers, you create a
situation where the civil liberties of those people are very much
in peril in a general matter. [I don't] think [there is any] analog
where you could randomly choose any person off the street and be
confident that they were committing an unlawful act that could put
them on the hook for potential felony liability or hundreds of
millions of dollars of civil liability. Certainly we all speed, but
speeding isn't the kind of an act for which we routinely forfeit
civil liberties. Some people use drugs, and I think that's the
closest analog, [but] many have noted that the war against drugs
has eroded all of our civil liberties because it's treated so many
Americans as criminals. Well, I think it's fair to say that file
sharing is an order of magnitude larger number of Americans than
drug use… . If forty to sixty million Americans have become
lawbreakers, then we're really on a slippery slope to lose a lot of
civil liberties for all forty to sixty million of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When forty to sixty million Americans are considered "criminals"
under the law, and when the law could achieve the same objective—
securing rights to authors—without these millions being considered
"criminals," who is the villain? Americans or the law? Which is
American, a constant war on our own people or a concerted effort
through our democracy to change our law?</p>
