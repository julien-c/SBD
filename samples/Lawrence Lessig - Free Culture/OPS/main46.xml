<h3 class="section_title">1. Rebuilding Freedoms Previously
Presumed: Examples</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>If you step back from the battle I've been describing here, you
will recognize this problem from other contexts. Think about
privacy. Before the Internet, most of us didn't have to worry much
about data about our lives that we broadcast to the world. If you
walked into a bookstore and browsed through some of the works of
Karl Marx, you didn't need to worry about explaining your browsing
habits to your neighbors or boss. The "privacy" of your browsing
habits was assured.</p>
<p>What made it assured?</p>
<p>Well, if we think in terms of the modalities I described in
chapter 10, your privacy was assured because of an inefficient
architecture for gathering data and hence a market constraint
(cost) on anyone who wanted to gather that data. If you were a
suspected spy for North Korea, working for the CIA, no doubt your
privacy would not be assured. But that's because the CIA would (we
hope) find it valuable enough to spend the thousands required to
track you. But for most of us (again, we can hope), spying doesn't
pay. The highly inefficient architecture of real space means we all
enjoy a fairly robust amount of privacy. That privacy is guaranteed
to us by friction. Not by law (there is no law protecting "privacy"
in public places), and in many places, not by norms (snooping and
gossip are just fun), but instead, by the costs that friction
imposes on anyone who would want to spy.</p>
<p>Enter the Internet, where the cost of tracking browsing in
particular has become quite tiny. If you're a customer at Amazon,
then as you browse the pages, Amazon collects the data about what
you've looked at. You know this because at the side of the page,
there's a list of "recently viewed" pages. Now, because of the
architecture of the Net and the function of cookies on the Net, it
is easier to collect the data than not. The friction has
disappeared, and hence any "privacy" protected by the friction
disappears, too.</p>
<p>Amazon, of course, is not the problem. But we might begin to
worry about libraries. If you're one of those crazy lefties who
thinks that people should have the "right" to browse in a library
without the government knowing which books you look at (I'm one of
those lefties, too), then this change in the technology of
monitoring might concern you. If it becomes simple to gather and
sort who does what in electronic spaces, then the friction-induced
privacy of yesterday disappears.</p>
<p>It is this reality that explains the push of many to define
"privacy" on the Internet. It is the recognition that technology
can remove what friction before gave us that leads many to push for
laws to do what friction did.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_210" id="footnote_210_call">[210]</a> And
whether you're in favor of those laws or not, it is the pattern
that is important here. We must take affirmative steps to secure a
kind of freedom that was passively provided before. A change in
technology now forces those who believe in privacy to affirmatively
act where, before, privacy was given by default.</p>
<p>A similar story could be told about the birth of the free
software movement. When computers with software were first made
available commercially, the software—both the source code and the
binaries— was free. You couldn't run a program written for a Data
General machine on an IBM machine, so Data General and IBM didn't
care much about controlling their software.</p>
<p>That was the world Richard Stallman was born into, and while he
was a researcher at MIT, he grew to love the community that
developed when one was free to explore and tinker with the software
that ran on machines. Being a smart sort himself, and a talented
programmer, Stallman grew to depend upon the freedom to add to or
modify other people's work.</p>
<p>In an academic setting, at least, that's not a terribly radical
idea. In a math department, anyone would be free to tinker with a
proof that someone offered. If you thought you had a better way to
prove a theorem, you could take what someone else did and change
it. In a classics department, if you believed a colleague's
translation of a recently discovered text was flawed, you were free
to improve it. Thus, to Stallman, it seemed obvious that you should
be free to tinker with and improve the code that ran a machine.
This, too, was knowledge. Why shouldn't it be open for criticism
like anything else?</p>
<p>No one answered that question. Instead, the architecture of
revenue for computing changed. As it became possible to import
programs from one system to another, it became economically
attractive (at least in the view of some) to hide the code of your
program. So, too, as companies started selling peripherals for
mainframe systems. If I could just take your printer driver and
copy it, then that would make it easier for me to sell a printer to
the market than it was for you.</p>
<p>Thus, the practice of proprietary code began to spread, and by
the early 1980s, Stallman found himself surrounded by proprietary
code. The world of free software had been erased by a change in the
economics of computing. And as he believed, if he did nothing about
it, then the freedom to change and share software would be
fundamentally weakened.</p>
<p>Therefore, in 1984, Stallman began a project to build a free
operating system, so that at least a strain of free software would
survive. That was the birth of the GNU project, into which Linus
Torvalds's "Linux" kernel was added to produce the GNU/Linux
operating system.</p>
<p>Stallman's technique was to use copyright law to build a world
of software that must be kept free. Software licensed under the
Free Software Foundation's GPL cannot be modified and distributed
unless the source code for that software is made available as well.
Thus, anyone building upon GPL'd software would have to make their
buildings free as well. This would assure, Stallman believed, that
an ecology of code would develop that remained free for others to
build upon. His fundamental goal was freedom; innovative creative
code was a byproduct.</p>
<p>Stallman was thus doing for software what privacy advocates now
do for privacy. He was seeking a way to rebuild a kind of freedom
that was taken for granted before. Through the affirmative use of
licenses that bind copyrighted code, Stallman was affirmatively
reclaiming a space where free software would survive. He was
actively protecting what before had been passively guaranteed.</p>
<p>Finally, consider a very recent example that more directly
resonates with the story of this book. This is the shift in the way
academic and scientific journals are produced.</p>
<p>As digital technologies develop, it is becoming obvious to many
that printing thousands of copies of journals every month and
sending them to libraries is perhaps not the most efficient way to
distribute knowledge. Instead, journals are increasingly becoming
electronic, and libraries and their users are given access to these
electronic journals through password-protected sites. Something
similar to this has been happening in law for almost thirty years:
Lexis and Westlaw have had electronic versions of case reports
available to subscribers to their service. Although a Supreme Court
opinion is not copyrighted, and anyone is free to go to a library
and read it, Lexis and Westlaw are also free to charge users for
the privilege of gaining access to that Supreme Court opinion
through their respective services.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong in general with this, and indeed, the
ability to charge for access to even public domain materials is a
good incentive for people to develop new and innovative ways to
spread knowledge. The law has agreed, which is why Lexis and
Westlaw have been allowed to flourish. And if there's nothing wrong
with selling the public domain, then there could be nothing wrong,
in principle, with selling access to material that is not in the
public domain.</p>
<p>But what if the only way to get access to social and scientific
data was through proprietary services? What if no one had the
ability to browse this data except by paying for a
subscription?</p>
<p>As many are beginning to notice, this is increasingly the
reality with scientific journals. When these journals were
distributed in paper form, libraries could make the journals
available to anyone who had access to the library. Thus, patients
with cancer could become cancer experts because the library gave
them access. Or patients trying to understand the risks of a
certain treatment could research those risks by reading all
available articles about that treatment. This freedom was therefore
a function of the institution of libraries (norms) and the
technology of paper journals (architecture)—namely, that it was
very hard to control access to a paper journal.</p>
<p>As journals become electronic, however, the publishers are
demanding that libraries not give the general public access to the
journals. This means that the freedoms provided by print journals
in public libraries begin to disappear. Thus, as with privacy and
with software, a changing technology and market shrink a freedom
taken for granted before.</p>
<p>This shrinking freedom has led many to take affirmative steps to
restore the freedom that has been lost. The Public Library of
Science (PLoS), for example, is a nonprofit corporation dedicated
to making scientific research available to anyone with a Web
connection. Authors of scientific work submit that work to the
Public Library of Science. That work is then subject to peer
review. If accepted, the work is then deposited in a public,
electronic archive and made permanently available for free. PLoS
also sells a print version of its work, but the copyright for the
print journal does not inhibit the right of anyone to redistribute
the work for free.</p>
<p>This is one of many such efforts to restore a freedom taken for
granted before, but now threatened by changing technology and
markets. There's no doubt that this alternative competes with the
traditional publishers and their efforts to make money from the
exclusive distribution of content. But competition in our tradition
is presumptively a good—especially when it helps spread knowledge
and science.</p>
