"Property"</h2>
<div class="text">
<p>Jack Valenti has been the president of the Motion Picture
Association of America since 1966. He first came to Washington,
D.C., with Lyndon Johnson's administration—literally. The famous
picture of Johnson's swearing-in on Air Force One after the
assassination of President Kennedy has Valenti in the background.
In his almost forty years of running the MPAA, Valenti has
established himself as perhaps the most prominent and effective
lobbyist in Washington.</p>
<p>The MPAA is the American branch of the international Motion
Picture Association. It was formed in 1922 as a trade association
whose goal was to defend American movies against increasing
domestic criticism. The organization now represents not only
filmmakers but producers and distributors of entertainment for
television, video, and cable. Its board is made up of the chairmen
and presidents of the seven major producers and distributors of
motion picture and television programs in the United States: Walt
Disney, Sony Pictures Entertainment, MGM, Paramount Pictures,
Twentieth Century Fox, Universal Studios, and Warner Brothers.</p>
<p>Valenti is only the third president of the MPAA. No president
before him has had as much influence over that organization, or
over Washington. As a Texan, Valenti has mastered the single most
important political skill of a Southerner—the ability to appear
simple and slow while hiding a lightning-fast intellect. To this
day, Valenti plays the simple, humble man. But this Harvard MBA,
and author of four books, who finished high school at the age of
fifteen and flew more than fifty combat missions in World War II,
is no Mr. Smith. When Valenti went to Washington, he mastered the
city in a quintessentially Washingtonian way.</p>
<p>In defending artistic liberty and the freedom of speech that our
culture depends upon, the MPAA has done important good. In crafting
the MPAA rating system, it has probably avoided a great deal of
speech-regulating harm. But there is an aspect to the
organization's mission that is both the most radical and the most
important. This is the organization's effort, epitomized in
Valenti's every act, to redefine the meaning of "creative
property."</p>
<p>In 1982, Valenti's testimony to Congress captured the strategy
perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No matter the lengthy arguments made, no matter the charges and
the counter-charges, no matter the tumult and the shouting,
reasonable men and women will keep returning to the fundamental
issue, the central theme which animates this entire debate:
Creative property owners must be accorded the same rights and
protection resident in all other property owners in the nation.
That is the issue. That is the question. And that is the rostrum on
which this entire hearing and the debates to follow must rest.
<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_118" id=
"footnote_118_call">[118]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The strategy of this rhetoric, like the strategy of most of
Valenti's rhetoric, is brilliant and simple and brilliant because
simple. The "central theme" to which "reasonable men and women"
will return is this: "Creative property owners must be accorded the
same rights and protections resident in all other property owners
in the nation." There are no second-class citizens, Valenti might
have continued. There should be no second-class property
owners.</p>
<p>This claim has an obvious and powerful intuitive pull. It is
stated with such clarity as to make the idea as obvious as the
notion that we use elections to pick presidents. But in fact, there
is no more extreme a claim made by anyone who is serious in this
debate than this claim of Valenti's. Jack Valenti, however sweet
and however brilliant, is perhaps the nation's foremost extremist
when it comes to the nature and scope of "creative property." His
views have no reasonable connection to our actual legal tradition,
even if the subtle pull of his Texan charm has slowly redefined
that tradition, at least in Washington.</p>
<p>While "creative property" is certainly "property" in a nerdy and
precise sense that lawyers are trained to understand,<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_119" id=
"footnote_119_call">[119]</a> it has never been the case, nor
should it be, that "creative property owners" have been "accorded
the same rights and protection resident in all other property
owners." Indeed, if creative property owners were given the same
rights as all other property owners, that would effect a radical,
and radically undesirable, change in our tradition.</p>
<p>Valenti knows this. But he speaks for an industry that cares
squat for our tradition and the values it represents. He speaks for
an industry that is instead fighting to restore the tradition that
the British overturned in 1710. In the world that Valenti's changes
would create, a powerful few would exercise powerful control over
how our creative culture would develop.</p>
<p>I have two purposes in this chapter. The first is to convince
you that, historically, Valenti's claim is absolutely wrong. The
second is to convince you that it would be terribly wrong for us to
reject our history. We have always treated rights in creative
property differently from the rights resident in all other property
owners. They have never been the same. And they should never be the
same, because, however counterintuitive this may seem, to make them
the same would be to fundamentally weaken the opportunity for new
creators to create. Creativity depends upon the owners of
creativity having less than perfect control.</p>
<p>Organizations such as the MPAA, whose board includes the most
powerful of the old guard, have little interest, their rhetoric
notwithstanding, in assuring that the new can displace them. No
organization does. No person does. (Ask me about tenure, for
example.) But what's good for the MPAA is not necessarily good for
America. A society that defends the ideals of free culture must
preserve precisely the opportunity for new creativity to threaten
the old. To get just a hint that there is something fundamentally
wrong in Valenti's argument, we need look no further than the
United States Constitution itself.</p>
<p>The framers of our Constitution loved "property." Indeed, so
strongly did they love property that they built into the
Constitution an important requirement. If the government takes your
property—if it condemns your house, or acquires a slice of land
from your farm—it is required, under the Fifth Amendment's "Takings
Clause," to pay you "just compensation" for that taking. The
Constitution thus guarantees that property is, in a certain sense,
sacred. It cannot ever be taken from the property owner unless the
government pays for the privilege.</p>
<p>Yet the very same Constitution speaks very differently about
what Valenti calls "creative property." In the clause granting
Congress the power to create "creative property," the Constitution
requires that after a "limited time," Congress take back the rights
that it has granted and set the "creative property" free to the
public domain. Yet when Congress does this, when the expiration of
a copyright term "takes" your copyright and turns it over to the
public domain, Congress does not have any obligation to pay "just
compensation" for this "taking." Instead, the same Constitution
that requires compensation for your land requires that you lose
your "creative property" right without any compensation at all.</p>
<p>The Constitution thus on its face states that these two forms of
property are not to be accorded the same rights. They are plainly
to be treated differently. Valenti is therefore not just asking for
a change in our tradition when he argues that creative-property
owners should be accorded the same rights as every other
property-right owner. He is effectively arguing for a change in our
Constitution itself.</p>
<p>Arguing for a change in our Constitution is not necessarily
wrong. There was much in our original Constitution that was plainly
wrong. The Constitution of 1789 entrenched slavery; it left
senators to be appointed rather than elected; it made it possible
for the electoral college to produce a tie between the president
and his own vice president (as it did in 1800). The framers were no
doubt extraordinary, but I would be the first to admit that they
made big mistakes. We have since rejected some of those mistakes;
no doubt there could be others that we should reject as well. So my
argument is not simply that because Jefferson did it, we should,
too.</p>
<p>Instead, my argument is that because Jefferson did it, we should
at least try to understand why. Why did the framers, fanatical
property types that they were, reject the claim that creative
property be given the same rights as all other property? Why did
they require that for creative property there must be a public
domain?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we need to get some perspective on the
history of these "creative property" rights, and the control that
they enabled. Once we see clearly how differently these rights have
been defined, we will be in a better position to ask the question
that should be at the core of this war: Not whether creative
property should be protected, but how. Not whether we will enforce
the rights the law gives to creative-property owners, but what the
particular mix of rights ought to be. Not whether artists should be
paid, but whether institutions designed to assure that artists get
paid need also control how culture develops.</p>
<p>To answer these questions, we need a more general way to talk
about how property is protected. More precisely, we need a more
general way than the narrow language of the law allows. In Code and
Other Laws of Cyberspace, I used a simple model to capture this
more general perspective. For any particular right or regulation,
this model asks how four different modalities of regulation
interact to support or weaken the right or regulation. I
represented it with this diagram:</p>
<p>(Figure 5.1)</p>
<p>At the center of this picture is a regulated dot: the individual
or group that is the target of regulation, or the holder of a
right. (In each case throughout, we can describe this either as
regulation or as a right. For simplicity's sake, I will speak only
of regulations.) The ovals represent four ways in which the
individual or group might be regulated— either constrained or,
alternatively, enabled. Law is the most obvious constraint (to
lawyers, at least). It constrains by threatening punishments after
the fact if the rules set in advance are violated. So if, for
example, you willfully infringe Madonna's copyright by copying a
song from her latest CD and posting it on the Web, you can be
punished with a $150,000 fine. The fine is an ex post punishment
for violating an ex ante rule. It is imposed by the state.</p>
<p>Norms are a different kind of constraint. They, too, punish an
individual for violating a rule. But the punishment of a norm is
imposed by a community, not (or not only) by the state. There may
be no law against spitting, but that doesn't mean you won't be
punished if you spit on the ground while standing in line at a
movie. The punishment might not be harsh, though depending upon the
community, it could easily be more harsh than many of the
punishments imposed by the state. The mark of the difference is not
the severity of the rule, but the source of the enforcement.</p>
<p>The market is a third type of constraint. Its constraint is
effected through conditions: You can do X if you pay Y; you'll be
paid M if you do N. These constraints are obviously not independent
of law or norms—it is property law that defines what must be bought
if it is to be taken legally; it is norms that say what is
appropriately sold. But given a set of norms, and a background of
property and contract law, the market imposes a simultaneous
constraint upon how an individual or group might behave.</p>
<p>Finally, and for the moment, perhaps, most mysteriously,
"architecture"—the physical world as one finds it—is a constraint
on behavior. A fallen bridge might constrain your ability to get
across a river. Railroad tracks might constrain the ability of a
community to integrate its social life. As with the market,
architecture does not effect its constraint through ex post
punishments. Instead, also as with the market, architecture effects
its constraint through simultaneous conditions. These conditions
are imposed not by courts enforcing contracts, or by police
punishing theft, but by nature, by "architecture." If a 500-pound
boulder blocks your way, it is the law of gravity that enforces
this constraint. If a $500 airplane ticket stands between you and a
flight to New York, it is the market that enforces this
constraint.</p>
<p>So the first point about these four modalities of regulation is
obvious: They interact. Restrictions imposed by one might be
reinforced by another. Or restrictions imposed by one might be
undermined by another.</p>
<p>The second point follows directly: If we want to understand the
effective freedom that anyone has at a given moment to do any
particular thing, we have to consider how these four modalities
interact. Whether or not there are other constraints (there may
well be; my claim is not about comprehensiveness), these four are
among the most significant, and any regulator (whether controlling
or freeing) must consider how these four in particular
interact.</p>
<p>So, for example, consider the "freedom" to drive a car at a high
speed. That freedom is in part restricted by laws: speed limits
that say how fast you can drive in particular places at particular
times. It is in part restricted by architecture: speed bumps, for
example, slow most rational drivers; governors in buses, as another
example, set the maximum rate at which the driver can drive. The
freedom is in part restricted by the market: Fuel efficiency drops
as speed increases, thus the price of gasoline indirectly
constrains speed. And finally, the norms of a community may or may
not constrain the freedom to speed. Drive at 50 mph by a school in
your own neighborhood and you're likely to be punished by the
neighbors. The same norm wouldn't be as effective in a different
town, or at night.</p>
<p>The final point about this simple model should also be fairly
clear: While these four modalities are analytically independent,
law has a special role in affecting the three.<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_120" id="footnote_120_call">[120]</a>
The law, in other words, sometimes operates to increase or decrease
the constraint of a particular modality. Thus, the law might be
used to increase taxes on gasoline, so as to increase the
incentives to drive more slowly. The law might be used to mandate
more speed bumps, so as to increase the difficulty of driving
rapidly. The law might be used to fund ads that stigmatize reckless
driving. Or the law might be used to require that other laws be
more strict—a federal requirement that states decrease the speed
limit, for example—so as to decrease the attractiveness of fast
driving.</p>
<p>(Figure 5.2)</p>
<p>These constraints can thus change, and they can be changed. To
understand the effective protection of liberty or protection of
property at any particular moment, we must track these changes over
time. A restriction imposed by one modality might be erased by
another. A freedom enabled by one modality might be displaced by
another.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_121" id=
