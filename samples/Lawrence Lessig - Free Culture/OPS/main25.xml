<h3 class="section_title">3. Law: Duration</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>When the first Congress enacted laws to protect creative
property, it faced the same uncertainty about the status of
creative property that the English had confronted in 1774. Many
states had passed laws protecting creative property, and some
believed that these laws simply supplemented common law rights that
already protected creative authorship.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_125" id="footnote_125_call">[125]</a> This
meant that there was no guaranteed public domain in the United
States in 1790. If copyrights were protected by the common law,
then there was no simple way to know whether a work published in
the United States was controlled or free. Just as in England, this
lingering uncertainty would make it hard for publishers to rely
upon a public domain to reprint and distribute works.</p>
<p>That uncertainty ended after Congress passed legislation
granting copyrights. Because federal law overrides any contrary
state law, federal protections for copyrighted works displaced any
state law protections. Just as in England the Statute of Anne
eventually meant that the copyrights for all English works expired,
a federal statute meant that any state copyrights expired as
well.</p>
<p>In 1790, Congress enacted the first copyright law. It created a
federal copyright and secured that copyright for fourteen years. If
the author was alive at the end of that fourteen years, then he
could opt to renew the copyright for another fourteen years. If he
did not renew the copyright, his work passed into the public
domain.</p>
<p>While there were many works created in the United States in the
first ten years of the Republic, only 5 percent of the works were
actually registered under the federal copyright regime. Of all the
work created in the United States both before 1790 and from 1790
through 1800, 95 percent immediately passed into the public domain;
the balance would pass into the public domain within twenty-eight
years at most, and more likely within fourteen years.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_126" id=
"footnote_126_call">[126]</a></p>
<p>This system of renewal was a crucial part of the American system
of copyright. It assured that the maximum terms of copyright would
be granted only for works where they were wanted. After the initial
term of fourteen years, if it wasn't worth it to an author to renew
his copyright, then it wasn't worth it to society to insist on the
copyright, either.</p>
<p>Fourteen years may not seem long to us, but for the vast
majority of copyright owners at that time, it was long enough: Only
a small minority of them renewed their copyright after fourteen
years; the balance allowed their work to pass into the public
domain.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_127" id=
"footnote_127_call">[127]</a></p>
<p>Even today, this structure would make sense. Most creative work
has an actual commercial life of just a couple of years. Most books
fall out of print after one year.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_128" id="footnote_128_call">[128]</a> When
that happens, the used books are traded free of copyright
regulation. Thus the books are no longer effectively controlled by
copyright. The only practical commercial use of the books at that
time is to sell the books as used books; that use—because it does
not involve publication—is effectively free.</p>
<p>In the first hundred years of the Republic, the term of
copyright was changed once. In 1831, the term was increased from a
maximum of 28 years to a maximum of 42 by increasing the initial
term of copyright from 14 years to 28 years. In the next fifty
years of the Republic, the term increased once again. In 1909,
Congress extended the renewal term of 14 years to 28 years, setting
a maximum term of 56 years.</p>
<p>Then, beginning in 1962, Congress started a practice that has
defined copyright law since. Eleven times in the last forty years,
Congress has extended the terms of existing copyrights; twice in
those forty years, Congress extended the term of future copyrights.
Initially, the extensions of existing copyrights were short, a mere
one to two years. In 1976, Congress extended all existing
copyrights by nineteen years. And in 1998, in the Sonny Bono
Copyright Term Extension Act, Congress extended the term of
existing and future copyrights by twenty years.</p>
<p>The effect of these extensions is simply to toll, or delay, the
passing of works into the public domain. This latest extension
means that the public domain will have been tolled for thirty-nine
out of fifty-five years, or 70 percent of the time since 1962.
Thus, in the twenty years after the Sonny Bono Act, while one
million patents will pass into the public domain, zero copyrights
will pass into the public domain by virtue of the expiration of a
copyright term.</p>
<p>The effect of these extensions has been exacerbated by another,
little-noticed change in the copyright law. Remember I said that
the framers established a two-part copyright regime, requiring a
copyright owner to renew his copyright after an initial term. The
requirement of renewal meant that works that no longer needed
copyright protection would pass more quickly into the public
domain. The works remaining under protection would be those that
had some continuing commercial value.</p>
<p>The United States abandoned this sensible system in 1976. For
all works created after 1978, there was only one copyright term—the
maximum term. For "natural" authors, that term was life plus fifty
years. For corporations, the term was seventy-five years. Then, in
1992, Congress abandoned the renewal requirement for all works
created before 1978. All works still under copyright would be
accorded the maximum term then available. After the Sonny Bono Act,
that term was ninety-five years.</p>
<p>This change meant that American law no longer had an automatic
way to assure that works that were no longer exploited passed into
the public domain. And indeed, after these changes, it is unclear
whether it is even possible to put works into the public domain.
The public domain is orphaned by these changes in copyright law.
Despite the requirement that terms be "limited," we have no
evidence that anything will limit them.</p>
<p>The effect of these changes on the average duration of copyright
is dramatic. In 1973, more than 85 percent of copyright owners
failed to renew their copyright. That meant that the average term
of copyright in 1973 was just 32.2 years. Because of the
elimination of the renewal requirement, the average term of
copyright is now the maximum term. In thirty years, then, the
average term has tripled, from 32.2 years to 95 years.<a class=
