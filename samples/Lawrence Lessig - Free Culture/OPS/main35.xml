<h3 class="section_title">2. Constraining Innovators</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The story of the last section was a crunchy-lefty
story—creativity quashed, artists who can't speak, yada yada yada.
Maybe that doesn't get you going. Maybe you think there's enough
weird art out there, and enough expression that is critical of what
seems to be just about everything. And if you think that, you might
think there's little in this story to worry you.</p>
<p>But there's an aspect of this story that is not lefty in any
sense. Indeed, it is an aspect that could be written by the most
extreme promarket ideologue. And if you're one of these sorts (and
a special one at that, 188 pages into a book like this), then you
can see this other aspect by substituting "free market" every place
I've spoken of "free culture." The point is the same, even if the
interests affecting culture are more fundamental.</p>
<p>The charge I've been making about the regulation of culture is
the same charge free marketers make about regulating markets.
Everyone, of course, concedes that some regulation of markets is
necessary—at a minimum, we need rules of property and contract, and
courts to enforce both. Likewise, in this culture debate, everyone
concedes that at least some framework of copyright is also
required. But both perspectives vehemently insist that just because
some regulation is good, it doesn't follow that more regulation is
better. And both perspectives are constantly attuned to the ways in
which regulation simply enables the powerful industries of today to
protect themselves against the competitors of tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is the single most dramatic effect of the shift in
regulatory strategy that I described in chapter 10. The consequence
of this massive threat of liability tied to the murky boundaries of
copyright law is that innovators who want to innovate in this space
can safely innovate only if they have the sign-off from last
generation's dominant industries. That lesson has been taught
through a series of cases that were designed and executed to teach
venture capitalists a lesson. That lesson—what former Napster CEO
Hank Barry calls a "nuclear pall" that has fallen over the
Valley—has been learned.</p>
<p>Consider one example to make the point, a story whose beginning
I told in The Future of Ideas and which has progressed in a way
that even I (pessimist extraordinaire) would never have
predicted.</p>
<p>In 1997, Michael Roberts launched a company called MP3.com.
MP3.com was keen to remake the music business. Their goal was not
just to facilitate new ways to get access to content. Their goal
was also to facilitate new ways to create content. Unlike the major
labels, MP3.com offered creators a venue to distribute their
creativity, without demanding an exclusive engagement from the
creators.</p>
<p>To make this system work, however, MP3.com needed a reliable way
to recommend music to its users. The idea behind this alternative
was to leverage the revealed preferences of music listeners to
recommend new artists. If you like Lyle Lovett, you're likely to
enjoy Bonnie Raitt. And so on.</p>
<p>This idea required a simple way to gather data about user
preferences. MP3.com came up with an extraordinarily clever way to
gather this preference data. In January 2000, the company launched
a service called my.mp3.com. Using software provided by MP3.com, a
user would sign into an account and then insert into her computer a
CD. The software would identify the CD, and then give the user
access to that content. So, for example, if you inserted a CD by
Jill Sobule, then wherever you were—at work or at home—you could
get access to that music once you signed into your account. The
system was therefore a kind of music-lockbox.</p>
<p>No doubt some could use this system to illegally copy content.
But that opportunity existed with or without MP3.com. The aim of
the my.mp3.com service was to give users access to their own
content, and as a by-product, by seeing the content they already
owned, to discover the kind of content the users liked.</p>
<p>To make this system function, however, MP3.com needed to copy
50,000 CDs to a server. (In principle, it could have been the user
who uploaded the music, but that would have taken a great deal of
time, and would have produced a product of questionable quality.)
It therefore purchased 50,000 CDs from a store, and started the
process of making copies of those CDs. Again, it would not serve
the content from those copies to anyone except those who
authenticated that they had a copy of the CD they wanted to access.
So while this was 50,000 copies, it was 50,000 copies directed at
giving customers something they had already bought.</p>
<p>Nine days after MP3.com launched its service, the five major
labels, headed by the RIAA, brought a lawsuit against MP3.com.
MP3.com settled with four of the five. Nine months later, a federal
judge found MP3.com to have been guilty of willful infringement
with respect to the fifth. Applying the law as it is, the judge
imposed a fine against MP3.com of $118 million. MP3.com then
settled with the remaining plaintiff, Vivendi Universal, paying
over $54 million. Vivendi purchased MP3.com just about a year
later.</p>
<p>That part of the story I have told before. Now consider its
conclusion.</p>
<p>After Vivendi purchased MP3.com, Vivendi turned around and filed
a malpractice lawsuit against the lawyers who had advised it that
they had a good faith claim that the service they wanted to offer
would be considered legal under copyright law. This lawsuit alleged
that it should have been obvious that the courts would find this
behavior illegal; therefore, this lawsuit sought to punish any
lawyer who had dared to suggest that the law was less restrictive
than the labels demanded.</p>
<p>The clear purpose of this lawsuit (which was settled for an
unspecified amount shortly after the story was no longer covered in
the press) was to send an unequivocal message to lawyers advising
clients in this space: It is not just your clients who might suffer
if the content industry directs its guns against them. It is also
you. So those of you who believe the law should be less restrictive
should realize that such a view of the law will cost you and your
firm dearly.</p>
<p>This strategy is not just limited to the lawyers. In April 2003,
Universal and EMI brought a lawsuit against Hummer Winblad, the
venture capital firm (VC) that had funded Napster at a certain
stage of its development, its cofounder ( John Hummer), and general
partner (Hank Barry).<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_160" id="footnote_160_call">[160]</a> The
claim here, as well, was that the VC should have recognized the
right of the content industry to control how the industry should
develop. They should be held personally liable for funding a
company whose business turned out to be beyond the law. Here again,
the aim of the lawsuit is transparent: Any VC now recognizes that
if you fund a company whose business is not approved of by the
dinosaurs, you are at risk not just in the marketplace, but in the
courtroom as well. Your investment buys you not only a company, it
also buys you a lawsuit. So extreme has the environment become that
even car manufacturers are afraid of technologies that touch
content. In an article in Business 2.0, Rafe Needleman describes a
discussion with BMW:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I asked why, with all the storage capacity and computer power in
the car, there was no way to play MP3 files. I was told that BMW
engineers in Germany had rigged a new vehicle to play MP3s via the
car's built-in sound system, but that the company's marketing and
legal departments weren't comfortable with pushing this forward for
release stateside. Even today, no new cars are sold in the United
States with bona fide MP3 players… .<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_161" id="footnote_161_call">[161]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the world of the mafia—filled with "your money or your
life" offers, governed in the end not by courts but by the threats
that the law empowers copyright holders to exercise. It is a system
that will obviously and necessarily stifle new innovation. It is
hard enough to start a company. It is impossibly hard if that
company is constantly threatened by litigation.</p>
<p>The point is not that businesses should have a right to start
illegal enterprises. The point is the definition of "illegal." The
law is a mess of uncertainty. We have no good way to know how it
should apply to new technologies. Yet by reversing our tradition of
judicial deference, and by embracing the astonishingly high
penalties that copyright law imposes, that uncertainty now yields a
reality which is far more conservative than is right. If the law
imposed the death penalty for parking tickets, we'd not only have
fewer parking tickets, we'd also have much less driving. The same
principle applies to innovation. If innovation is constantly
checked by this uncertain and unlimited liability, we will have
much less vibrant innovation and much less creativity.</p>
<p>The point is directly parallel to the crunchy-lefty point about
fair use. Whatever the "real" law is, realism about the effect of
law in both contexts is the same. This wildly punitive system of
regulation will systematically stifle creativity and innovation. It
will protect some industries and some creators, but it will harm
industry and creativity generally. Free market and free culture
depend upon vibrant competition. Yet the effect of the law today is
to stifle just this kind of competition. The effect is to produce
an overregulated culture, just as the effect of too much control in
the market is to produce an overregulatedregulated market.</p>
<p>The building of a permission culture, rather than a free
culture, is the first important way in which the changes I have
described will burden innovation. A permission culture means a
lawyer's culture—a culture in which the ability to create requires
a call to your lawyer. Again, I am not antilawyer, at least when
they're kept in their proper place. I am certainly not antilaw. But
our profession has lost the sense of its limits. And leaders in our
profession have lost an appreciation of the high costs that our
profession imposes upon others. The inefficiency of the law is an
embarrassment to our tradition. And while I believe our profession
should therefore do everything it can to make the law more
efficient, it should at least do everything it can to limit the
reach of the law where the law is not doing any good. The
transaction costs buried within a permission culture are enough to
bury a wide range of creativity. Someone needs to do a lot of
justifying to justify that result. The uncertainty of the law is
one burden on innovation. There is a second burden that operates
more directly. This is the effort by many in the content industry
to use the law to directly regulate the technology of the Internet
so that it better protects their content.</p>
<p>The motivation for this response is obvious. The Internet
enables the efficient spread of content. That efficiency is a
feature of the Internet's design. But from the perspective of the
content industry, this feature is a "bug." The efficient spread of
content means that content distributors have a harder time
controlling the distribution of content. One obvious response to
this efficiency is thus to make the Internet less efficient. If the
Internet enables "piracy," then, this response says, we should
break the kneecaps of the Internet.</p>
<p>The examples of this form of legislation are many. At the urging
of the content industry, some in Congress have threatened
legislation that would require computers to determine whether the
content they access is protected or not, and to disable the spread
of protected content.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_162" id="footnote_162_call">[162]</a>
Congress has already launched proceedings to explore a mandatory
"broadcast flag" that would be required on any device capable of
transmitting digital video (i.e., a computer), and that would
disable the copying of any content that is marked with a broadcast
flag. Other members of Congress have proposed immunizing content
providers from liability for technology they might deploy that
would hunt down copyright violators and disable their
machines.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_163" id=
"footnote_163_call">[163]</a></p>
<p>In one sense, these solutions seem sensible. If the problem is
the code, why not regulate the code to remove the problem. But any
regulation of technical infrastructure will always be tuned to the
particular technology of the day. It will impose significant
burdens and costs on the technology, but will likely be eclipsed by
advances around exactly those requirements.</p>
<p>In March 2002, a broad coalition of technology companies, led by
Intel, tried to get Congress to see the harm that such legislation
would impose.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_164"
id="footnote_164_call">[164]</a> Their argument was obviously not
that copyright should not be protected. Instead, they argued, any
protection should not do more harm than good.</p>
<p>There is one more obvious way in which this war has harmed
innovation—again, a story that will be quite familiar to the free
market crowd.</p>
<p>Copyright may be property, but like all property, it is also a
form of regulation. It is a regulation that benefits some and harms
others. When done right, it benefits creators and harms leeches.
When done wrong, it is regulation the powerful use to defeat
competitors.</p>
<p>As I described in chapter 10, despite this feature of copyright
as regulation, and subject to important qualifications outlined by
Jessica Litman in her book Digital Copyright,<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_165" id="footnote_165_call">[165]</a>
overall this history of copyright is not bad. As chapter 10
details, when new technologies have come along, Congress has struck
a balance to assure that the new is protected from the old.
Compulsory, or statutory, licenses have been one part of that
strategy. Free use (as in the case of the VCR) has been
another.</p>
<p>But that pattern of deference to new technologies has now
changed with the rise of the Internet. Rather than striking a
balance between the claims of a new technology and the legitimate
rights of content creators, both the courts and Congress have
imposed legal restrictions that will have the effect of smothering
the new to benefit the old.</p>
<p>The response by the courts has been fairly universal.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_166" id=
"footnote_166_call">[166]</a> It has been mirrored in the responses
threatened and actually implemented by Congress. I won't catalog
all of those responses here.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_167" id="footnote_167_call">[167]</a> But
there is one example that captures the flavor of them all. This is
the story of the demise of Internet radio.</p>
<p>As I described in chapter 4, when a radio station plays a song,
the recording artist doesn't get paid for that "radio performance"
unless he or she is also the composer. So, for example if Marilyn
Monroe had recorded a version of "Happy Birthday"—to memorialize
her famous performance before President Kennedy at Madison Square
Garden— then whenever that recording was played on the radio, the
current copyright owners of "Happy Birthday" would get some money,
whereas Marilyn Monroe would not.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind this balance struck by Congress makes some
sense. The justification was that radio was a kind of advertising.
The recording artist thus benefited because by playing her music,
the radio station was making it more likely that her records would
be purchased. Thus, the recording artist got something, even if
only indirectly. Probably this reasoning had less to do with the
result than with the power of radio stations: Their lobbyists were
quite good at stopping any efforts to get Congress to require
compensation to the recording artists.</p>
<p>Enter Internet radio. Like regular radio, Internet radio is a
technology to stream content from a broadcaster to a listener. The
broadcast travels across the Internet, not across the ether of
radio spectrum. Thus, I can "tune in" to an Internet radio station
in Berlin while sitting in San Francisco, even though there's no
way for me to tune in to a regular radio station much beyond the
San Francisco metropolitan area.</p>
<p>This feature of the architecture of Internet radio means that
there are potentially an unlimited number of radio stations that a
user could tune in to using her computer, whereas under the
existing architecture for broadcast radio, there is an obvious
limit to the number of broadcasters and clear broadcast
frequencies. Internet radio could therefore be more competitive
than regular radio; it could provide a wider range of selections.
And because the potential audience for Internet radio is the whole
world, niche stations could easily develop and market their content
to a relatively large number of users worldwide. According to some
estimates, more than eighty million users worldwide have tuned in
to this new form of radio.</p>
<p>Internet radio is thus to radio what FM was to AM. It is an
improvement potentially vastly more significant than the FM
improvement over AM, since not only is the technology better, so,
too, is the competition. Indeed, there is a direct parallel between
the fight to establish FM radio and the fight to protect Internet
radio. As one author describes Howard Armstrong's struggle to
enable FM radio,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An almost unlimited number of FM stations was possible in the
shortwaves, thus ending the unnatural restrictions imposed on radio
in the crowded longwaves. If FM were freely developed, the number
of stations would be limited only by economics and competition
rather than by technical restrictions… . Armstrong likened the
situation that had grown up in radio to that following the
invention of the printing press, when governments and ruling
interests attempted to control this new instrument of mass
communications by imposing restrictive licenses on it. This tyranny
was broken only when it became possible for men freely to acquire
printing presses and freely to run them. FM in this sense was as
great an invention as the printing presses, for it gave radio the
opportunity to strike off its shackles.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_168" id="footnote_168_call">[168]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This potential for FM radio was never realized—not because
Armstrong was wrong about the technology, but because he
underestimated the power of "vested interests, habits, customs and
legislation"<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_169"
id="footnote_169_call">[169]</a> to retard the growth of this
competing technology.</p>
<p>Now the very same claim could be made about Internet radio. For
again, there is no technical limitation that could restrict the
number of Internet radio stations. The only restrictions on
Internet radio are those imposed by the law. Copyright law is one
such law. So the first question we should ask is, what copyright
rules would govern Internet radio?</p>
<p>But here the power of the lobbyists is reversed. Internet radio
is a new industry. The recording artists, on the other hand, have a
very powerful lobby, the RIAA. Thus when Congress considered the
phenomenon of Internet radio in 1995, the lobbyists had primed
Congress to adopt a different rule for Internet radio than the rule
that applies to terrestrial radio. While terrestrial radio does not
have to pay our hypothetical Marilyn Monroe when it plays her
hypothetical recording of "Happy Birthday" on the air, Internet
radio does. Not only is the law not neutral toward Internet
radio—the law actually burdens Internet radio more than it burdens
terrestrial radio.</p>
<p>This financial burden is not slight. As Harvard law professor
William Fisher estimates, if an Internet radio station distributed
adfree popular music to (on average) ten thousand listeners,
twenty-four hours a day, the total artist fees that radio station
would owe would be over $1 million a year.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_170" id="footnote_170_call">[170]</a> A
regular radio station broadcasting the same content would pay no
equivalent fee.</p>
<p>The burden is not financial only. Under the original rules that
were proposed, an Internet radio station (but not a terrestrial
radio station) would have to collect the following data from every
listening transaction:</p>
<p>1. name of the service;</p>
<p>2. channel of the program (AM/FM stations use station ID);</p>
<p>3. type of program (archived/looped/live);</p>
<p>4. date of transmission;</p>
<p>5. time of transmission;</p>
<p>6. time zone of origination of transmission;</p>
<p>7. numeric designation of the place of the sound recording
within the program;</p>
<p>8. duration of transmission (to nearest second);</p>
<p>9. sound recording title;</p>
<p>10. ISRC code of the recording;</p>
<p>11. release year of the album per copyright notice and in the
case of compilation albums, the release year of the album and copy-
right date of the track;</p>
<p>12. featured recording artist;</p>
<p>13. retail album title;</p>
<p>14. recording label;</p>
<p>15. UPC code of the retail album;</p>
<p>16. catalog number;</p>
<p>17. copyright owner information;</p>
<p>18. musical genre of the channel or program (station
format);</p>
<p>19. name of the service or entity;</p>
<p>20. channel or program;</p>
<p>21. date and time that the user logged in (in the user's time
zone);</p>
<p>22. date and time that the user logged out (in the user's time
zone);</p>
<p>23. time zone where the signal was received (user);</p>
<p>24. Unique User identifier;</p>
<p>25. the country in which the user received the
transmissions.</p>
<p>The Librarian of Congress eventually suspended these reporting
requirements, pending further study. And he also changed the
original rates set by the arbitration panel charged with setting
rates. But the basic difference between Internet radio and
terrestrial radio remains: Internet radio has to pay a type of
copyright fee that terrestrial radio does not.</p>
<p>Why? What justifies this difference? Was there any study of the
economic consequences from Internet radio that would justify these
differences? Was the motive to protect artists against piracy?</p>
<p>In a rare bit of candor, one RIAA expert admitted what seemed
obvious to everyone at the time. As Alex Alben, vice president for
Public Policy at Real Networks, told me,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The RIAA, which was representing the record labels, presented
some testimony about what they thought a willing buyer would pay to
a willing seller, and it was much higher. It was ten times higher
than what radio stations pay to perform the same songs for the same
period of time. And so the attorneys representing the webcasters
asked the RIAA,&#160;… "How do you come up with a rate that's so
much higher? Why is it worth more than radio? Because here we have
hundreds of thousands of webcasters who want to pay, and that
should establish the market rate, and if you set the rate so high,
you're going to drive the small webcasters out of business… ."</p>
<p>And the RIAA experts said, "Well, we don't really model this as
an industry with thousands of webcasters, we think it should be an
industry with, you know, five or seven big players who can pay a
high rate and it's a stable, predictable market." (Emphasis
added.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Translation: The aim is to use the law to eliminate competition,
so that this platform of potentially immense competition, which
would cause the diversity and range of content available to
explode, would not cause pain to the dinosaurs of old. There is no
one, on either the right or the left, who should endorse this use
of the law. And yet there is practically no one, on either the
right or the left, who is doing anything effective to prevent
it.</p>
