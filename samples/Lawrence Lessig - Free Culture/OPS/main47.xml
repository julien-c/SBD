<h3 class="section_title">2. Rebuilding Free Culture: One Idea</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The same strategy could be applied to culture, as a response to
the increasing control effected through law and technology.</p>
<p>Enter the Creative Commons. The Creative Commons is a nonprofit
corporation established in Massachusetts, but with its home at
Stanford University. Its aim is to build a layer of reasonable
copyright on top of the extremes that now reign. It does this by
making it easy for people to build upon other people's work, by
making it simple for creators to express the freedom for others to
take and build upon their work. Simple tags, tied to human-readable
descriptions, tied to bulletproof licenses, make this possible.</p>
<p>Simple—which means without a middleman, or without a lawyer. By
developing a free set of licenses that people can attach to their
content, Creative Commons aims to mark a range of content that can
easily, and reliably, be built upon. These tags are then linked to
machine-readable versions of the license that enable computers
automatically to identify content that can easily be shared. These
three expressions together—a legal license, a human-readable
description, and machine-readable tags—constitute a Creative
Commons license. A Creative Commons license constitutes a grant of
freedom to anyone who accesses the license, and more importantly,
an expression of the ideal that the person associated with the
license believes in something different than the "All" or "No"
extremes. Content is marked with the CC mark, which does not mean
that copyright is waived, but that certain freedoms are given.</p>
<p>These freedoms are beyond the freedoms promised by fair use.
Their precise contours depend upon the choices the creator makes.
The creator can choose a license that permits any use, so long as
attribution is given. She can choose a license that permits only
noncommercial use. She can choose a license that permits any use so
long as the same freedoms are given to other uses ("share and share
alike"). Or any use so long as no derivative use is made. Or any
use at all within developing nations. Or any sampling use, so long
as full copies are not made. Or lastly, any educational use.</p>
<p>These choices thus establish a range of freedoms beyond the
default of copyright law. They also enable freedoms that go beyond
traditional fair use. And most importantly, they express these
freedoms in a way that subsequent users can use and rely upon
without the need to hire a lawyer. Creative Commons thus aims to
build a layer of content, governed by a layer of reasonable
copyright law, that others can build upon. Voluntary choice of
individuals and creators will make this content available. And that
content will in turn enable us to rebuild a public domain.</p>
<p>This is just one project among many within the Creative Commons.
And of course, Creative Commons is not the only organization
pursuing such freedoms. But the point that distinguishes the
Creative Commons from many is that we are not interested only in
talking about a public domain or in getting legislators to help
build a public domain. Our aim is to build a movement of consumers
and producers of content ("content conducers," as attorney Mia
Garlick calls them) who help build the public domain and, by their
work, demonstrate the importance of the public domain to other
creativity.</p>
<p>The aim is not to fight the "All Rights Reserved" sorts. The aim
is to complement them. The problems that the law creates for us as
a culture are produced by insane and unintended consequences of
laws written centuries ago, applied to a technology that only
Jefferson could have imagined. The rules may well have made sense
against a background of technologies from centuries ago, but they
do not make sense against the background of digital technologies.
New rules—with different freedoms, expressed in ways so that humans
without lawyers can use them—are needed. Creative Commons gives
people a way effectively to begin to build those rules.</p>
<p>Why would creators participate in giving up total control? Some
participate to better spread their content. Cory Doctorow, for
example, is a science fiction author. His first novel, Down and Out
in the Magic Kingdom, was released on-line and for free, under a
Creative Commons license, on the same day that it went on sale in
bookstores.</p>
<p>Why would a publisher ever agree to this? I suspect his
publisher reasoned like this: There are two groups of people out
there: (1) those who will buy Cory's book whether or not it's on
the Internet, and (2) those who may never hear of Cory's book, if
it isn't made available for free on the Internet. Some part of (1)
will download Cory's book instead of buying it. Call them bad-(1)s.
Some part of (2) will download Cory's book, like it, and then
decide to buy it. Call them (2)-goods. If there are more (2)-goods
than bad-(1)s, the strategy of releasing Cory's book free on-line
will probably increase sales of Cory's book.</p>
<p>Indeed, the experience of his publisher clearly supports that
conclusion. The book's first printing was exhausted months before
the publisher had expected. This first novel of a science fiction
author was a total success.</p>
<p>The idea that free content might increase the value of nonfree
content was confirmed by the experience of another author. Peter
Wayner, who wrote a book about the free software movement titled
Free for All, made an electronic version of his book free on-line
under a Creative Commons license after the book went out of print.
He then monitored used book store prices for the book. As
predicted, as the number of downloads increased, the used book
price for his book increased, as well.</p>
<p>These are examples of using the Commons to better spread
proprietary content. I believe that is a wonderful and common use
of the Commons. There are others who use Creative Commons licenses
for other reasons. Many who use the "sampling license" do so
because anything else would be hypocritical. The sampling license
says that others are free, for commercial or noncommercial
purposes, to sample content from the licensed work; they are just
not free to make full copies of the licensed work available to
others. This is consistent with their own art—they, too, sample
from others. Because the legal costs of sampling are so high
(Walter Leaphart, manager of the rap group Public Enemy, which was
born sampling the music of others, has stated that he does not
"allow" Public Enemy to sample anymore, because the legal costs are
so high<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_211" id=
"footnote_211_call">[211]</a> ), these artists release into the
creative environment content that others can build upon, so that
their form of creativity might grow.</p>
<p>Finally, there are many who mark their content with a Creative
Commons license just because they want to express to others the
importance of balance in this debate. If you just go along with the
system as it is, you are effectively saying you believe in the "All
Rights Reserved" model. Good for you, but many do not. Many believe
that however appropriate that rule is for Hollywood and freaks, it
is not an appropriate description of how most creators view the
rights associated with their content. The Creative Commons license
expresses this notion of "Some Rights Reserved," and gives many the
chance to say it to others.</p>
<p>In the first six months of the Creative Commons experiment, over
1 million objects were licensed with these free-culture licenses.
The next step is partnerships with middleware content providers to
help them build into their technologies simple ways for users to
mark their content with Creative Commons freedoms. Then the next
step is to watch and celebrate creators who build content based
upon content set free.</p>
<p>These are first steps to rebuilding a public domain. They are
not mere arguments; they are action. Building a public domain is
the first step to showing people how important that domain is to
creativity and innovation. Creative Commons relies upon voluntary
steps to achieve this rebuilding. They will lead to a world in
which more than voluntary steps are possible.</p>
<p>Creative Commons is just one example of voluntary efforts by
individuals and creators to change the mix of rights that now
govern the creative field. The project does not compete with
copyright; it complements it. Its aim is not to defeat the rights
of authors, but to make it easier for authors and creators to
exercise their rights more flexibly and cheaply. That difference,
we believe, will enable creativity to spread more easily.</p>
