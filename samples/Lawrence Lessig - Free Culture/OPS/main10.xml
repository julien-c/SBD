<h3 class="section_title">2. Recorded Music</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The record industry was born of another kind of piracy, though
to see how requires a bit of detail about the way the law regulates
music.</p>
<p>At the time that Edison and Henri Fourneaux invented machines
for reproducing music (Edison the phonograph, Fourneaux the player
piano), the law gave composers the exclusive right to control
copies of their music and the exclusive right to control public
performances of their music. In other words, in 1900, if I wanted a
copy of Phil Russel's 1899 hit "Happy Mose," the law said I would
have to pay for the right to get a copy of the musical score, and I
would also have to pay for the right to perform it publicly.</p>
<p>But what if I wanted to record "Happy Mose," using Edison's
phonograph or Fourneaux's player piano? Here the law stumbled. It
was clear enough that I would have to buy any copy of the musical
score that I performed in making this recording. And it was clear
enough that I would have to pay for any public performance of the
work I was recording. But it wasn't totally clear that I would have
to pay for a "public performance" if I recorded the song in my own
house (even today, you don't owe the Beatles anything if you sing
their songs in the shower), or if I recorded the song from memory
(copies in your brain are not—yet— regulated by copyright law). So
if I simply sang the song into a recording device in the privacy of
my own home, it wasn't clear that I owed the composer anything. And
more importantly, it wasn't clear whether I owed the composer
anything if I then made copies of those recordings. Because of this
gap in the law, then, I could effectively pirate someone else's
song without paying its composer anything.</p>
<p>The composers (and publishers) were none too happy about this
capacity to pirate. As South Dakota senator Alfred Kittredge put
it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine the injustice of the thing. A composer writes a song or
an opera. A publisher buys at great expense the rights to the same
and copyrights it. Along come the phonographic companies and
companies who cut music rolls and deliberately steal the work of
the brain of the composer and publisher without any regard for
[their] rights.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_54"
id="footnote_54_call">[54]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The innovators who developed the technology to record other
people's works were "sponging upon the toil, the work, the talent,
and genius of American composers,"<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_55" id="footnote_55_call">[55]</a> and the
"music publishing industry" was thereby "at the complete mercy of
this one pirate."<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_56" id="footnote_56_call">[56]</a> As John
Philip Sousa put it, in as direct a way as possible, "When they
make money out of my pieces, I want a share of it."<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_57" id=
"footnote_57_call">[57]</a></p>
<p>These arguments have familiar echoes in the wars of our day. So,
too, do the arguments on the other side. The innovators who
developed the player piano argued that "it is perfectly
demonstrable that the introduction of automatic music players has
not deprived any composer of anything he had before their
introduction." Rather, the machines increased the sales of sheet
music.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_58" id=
"footnote_58_call">[58]</a> In any case, the innovators argued, the
job of Congress was "to consider first the interest of [the
public], whom they represent, and whose servants they are." "All
talk about `theft,'" the general counsel of the American
Graphophone Company wrote, "is the merest claptrap, for there
exists no property in ideas musical, literary or artistic, except
as defined by statute."<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_59" id="footnote_59_call">[59]</a></p>
<p>The law soon resolved this battle in favor of the composer and
the recording artist. Congress amended the law to make sure that
composers would be paid for the "mechanical reproductions" of their
music. But rather than simply granting the composer complete
control over the right to make mechanical reproductions, Congress
gave recording artists a right to record the music, at a price set
by Congress, once the composer allowed it to be recorded once. This
is the part of copyright law that makes cover songs possible. Once
a composer authorizes a recording of his song, others are free to
record the same song, so long as they pay the original composer a
fee set by the law.</p>
<p>American law ordinarily calls this a "compulsory license," but I
will refer to it as a "statutory license." A statutory license is a
license whose key terms are set by law. After Congress's amendment
of the Copyright Act in 1909, record companies were free to
distribute copies of recordings so long as they paid the composer
(or copyright holder) the fee set by the statute.</p>
<p>This is an exception within the law of copyright. When John
Grisham writes a novel, a publisher is free to publish that novel
only if Grisham gives the publisher permission. Grisham, in turn,
is free to charge whatever he wants for that permission. The price
to publish Grisham is thus set by Grisham, and copyright law
ordinarily says you have no permission to use Grisham's work except
with permission of Grisham.</p>
<p>But the law governing recordings gives recording artists less.
And thus, in effect, the law subsidizes the recording industry
through a kind of piracy—by giving recording artists a weaker right
than it otherwise gives creative authors. The Beatles have less
control over their creative work than Grisham does. And the
beneficiaries of this less control are the recording industry and
the public. The recording industry gets something of value for less
than it otherwise would pay; the public gets access to a much wider
range of musical creativity. Indeed, Congress was quite explicit
about its reasons for granting this right. Its fear was the
monopoly power of rights holders, and that that power would stifle
follow-on creativity.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_60" id="footnote_60_call">[60]</a></p>
<p>While the recording industry has been quite coy about this
recently, historically it has been quite a supporter of the
statutory license for records. As a 1967 report from the House
Committee on the Judiciary relates,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the record producers argued vigorously that the compulsory
license system must be retained. They asserted that the record
industry is a half-billion-dollar business of great economic
importance in the United States and throughout the world; records
today are the principal means of disseminating music, and this
creates special problems, since performers need unhampered access
to musical material on nondiscriminatory terms. Historically, the
record producers pointed out, there were no recording rights before
1909 and the 1909 statute adopted the compulsory license as a
deliberate anti-monopoly condition on the grant of these rights.
They argue that the result has been an outpouring of recorded
music, with the public being given lower prices, improved quality,
and a greater choice.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_61" id="footnote_61_call">[61]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By limiting the rights musicians have, by partially pirating
their creative work, the record producers, and the public,
benefit.</p>
