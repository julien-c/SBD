Them, Soon</h2>

<p>We will not reclaim a free culture by individual action alone.
It will also take important reforms of laws. We have a long way to
go before the politicians will listen to these ideas and implement
these reforms. But that also means that we have time to build
awareness around the changes that we need.</p>
<p>In this chapter, I outline five kinds of changes: four that are
general, and one that's specific to the most heated battle of the
day, music. Each is a step, not an end. But any of these steps
would carry us a long way to our end.</p>
