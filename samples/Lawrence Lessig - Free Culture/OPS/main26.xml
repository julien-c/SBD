<h3 class="section_title">4. Law: Scope</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The "scope" of a copyright is the range of rights granted by the
law. The scope of American copyright has changed dramatically.
Those changes are not necessarily bad. But we should understand the
extent of the changes if we're to keep this debate in context.</p>
<p>In 1790, that scope was very narrow. Copyright covered only
"maps, charts, and books." That means it didn't cover, for example,
music or architecture. More significantly, the right granted by a
copyright gave the author the exclusive right to "publish"
copyrighted works. That means someone else violated the copyright
only if he republished the work without the copyright owner's
permission. Finally, the right granted by a copyright was an
exclusive right to that particular book. The right did not extend
to what lawyers call "derivative works." It would not, therefore,
interfere with the right of someone other than the author to
translate a copyrighted book, or to adapt the story to a different
form (such as a drama based on a published book).</p>
<p>This, too, has changed dramatically. While the contours of
copyright today are extremely hard to describe simply, in general
terms, the right covers practically any creative work that is
reduced to a tangible form. It covers music as well as
architecture, drama as well as computer programs. It gives the
copyright owner of that creative work not only the exclusive right
to "publish" the work, but also the exclusive right of control over
any "copies" of that work. And most significant for our purposes
here, the right gives the copyright owner control over not only his
or her particular work, but also any "derivative work" that might
grow out of the original work. In this way, the right covers more
creative work, protects the creative work more broadly, and
protects works that are based in a significant way on the initial
creative work.</p>
<p>At the same time that the scope of copyright has expanded,
procedural limitations on the right have been relaxed. I've already
described the complete removal of the renewal requirement in 1992.
In addition to the renewal requirement, for most of the history of
American copyright law, there was a requirement that a work be
registered before it could receive the protection of a copyright.
There was also a requirement that any copyrighted work be marked
either with that famous © or the word copyright. And for most of
the history of American copyright law, there was a requirement that
works be deposited with the government before a copyright could be
secured.</p>
<p>The reason for the registration requirement was the sensible
understanding that for most works, no copyright was required.
Again, in the first ten years of the Republic, 95 percent of works
eligible for copyright were never copyrighted. Thus, the rule
reflected the norm: Most works apparently didn't need copyright, so
registration narrowed the regulation of the law to the few that
did. The same reasoning justified the requirement that a work be
marked as copyrighted—that way it was easy to know whether a
copyright was being claimed. The requirement that works be
deposited was to assure that after the copyright expired, there
would be a copy of the work somewhere so that it could be copied by
others without locating the original author.</p>
<p>All of these "formalities" were abolished in the American system
when we decided to follow European copyright law. There is no
requirement that you register a work to get a copyright; the
copyright now is automatic; the copyright exists whether or not you
mark your work with a ©; and the copyright exists whether or not
you actually make a copy available for others to copy.</p>
<p>Consider a practical example to understand the scope of these
differences.</p>
<p>If, in 1790, you wrote a book and you were one of the 5 percent
who actually copyrighted that book, then the copyright law
protected you against another publisher's taking your book and
republishing it without your permission. The aim of the act was to
regulate publishers so as to prevent that kind of unfair
competition. In 1790, there were 174 publishers in the United
States.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_130" id=
"footnote_130_call">[130]</a> The Copyright Act was thus a tiny
regulation of a tiny proportion of a tiny part of the creative
market in the United States—publishers.</p>
<p>The act left other creators totally unregulated. If I copied
your poem by hand, over and over again, as a way to learn it by
heart, my act was totally unregulated by the 1790 act. If I took
your novel and made a play based upon it, or if I translated it or
abridged it, none of those activities were regulated by the
original copyright act. These creative activities remained free,
while the activities of publishers were restrained.</p>
<p>Today the story is very different: If you write a book, your
book is automatically protected. Indeed, not just your book. Every
e-mail, every note to your spouse, every doodle, every creative act
that's reduced to a tangible form—all of this is automatically
copyrighted. There is no need to register or mark your work. The
protection follows the creation, not the steps you take to protect
it.</p>
<p>That protection gives you the right (subject to a narrow range
of fair use exceptions) to control how others copy the work,
whether they copy it to republish it or to share an excerpt.</p>
<p>That much is the obvious part. Any system of copyright would
control competing publishing. But there's a second part to the
copyright of today that is not at all obvious. This is the
protection of "derivative rights." If you write a book, no one can
make a movie out of your book without permission. No one can
translate it without permission. CliffsNotes can't make an
abridgment unless permission is granted. All of these derivative
uses of your original work are controlled by the copyright holder.
The copyright, in other words, is now not just an exclusive right
to your writings, but an exclusive right to your writings and a
large proportion of the writings inspired by them.</p>
<p>It is this derivative right that would seem most bizarre to our
framers, though it has become second nature to us. Initially, this
expansion was created to deal with obvious evasions of a narrower
copyright. If I write a book, can you change one word and then
claim a copyright in a new and different book? Obviously that would
make a joke of the copyright, so the law was properly expanded to
include those slight modifications as well as the verbatim original
work.</p>
<p>In preventing that joke, the law created an astonishing power
within a free culture—at least, it's astonishing when you
understand that the law applies not just to the commercial
publisher but to anyone with a computer. I understand the wrong in
duplicating and selling someone else's work. But whatever that
wrong is, transforming someone else's work is a different wrong.
Some view transformation as no wrong at all—they believe that our
law, as the framers penned it, should not protect derivative rights
at all.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_131" id=
"footnote_131_call">[131]</a> Whether or not you go that far, it
seems plain that whatever wrong is involved is fundamentally
different from the wrong of direct piracy.</p>
<p>Yet copyright law treats these two different wrongs in the same
way. I can go to court and get an injunction against your pirating
my book. I can go to court and get an injunction against your
transformative use of my book.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_132" id="footnote_132_call">[132]</a> These
two different uses of my creative work are treated the same.</p>
<p>This again may seem right to you. If I wrote a book, then why
should you be able to write a movie that takes my story and makes
money from it without paying me or crediting me? Or if Disney
creates a creature called "Mickey Mouse," why should you be able to
make Mickey Mouse toys and be the one to trade on the value that
Disney originally created?</p>
<p>These are good arguments, and, in general, my point is not that
the derivative right is unjustified. My aim just now is much
narrower: simply to make clear that this expansion is a significant
change from the rights originally granted.</p>
