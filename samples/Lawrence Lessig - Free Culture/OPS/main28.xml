<h3 class="section_title">6. Architecture and Law: Force</h3>
<div class="text">
<p>The disappearance of unregulated uses would be change enough,
but a second important change brought about by the Internet
magnifies its significance. This second change does not affect the
reach of copyright regulation; it affects how such regulation is
enforced.</p>
<p>In the world before digital technology, it was generally the law
that controlled whether and how someone was regulated by copyright
law. The law, meaning a court, meaning a judge: In the end, it was
a human, trained in the tradition of the law and cognizant of the
balances that tradition embraced, who said whether and how the law
would restrict your freedom.</p>
<p>There's a famous story about a battle between the Marx Brothers
and Warner Brothers. The Marxes intended to make a parody of
Casablanca. Warner Brothers objected. They wrote a nasty letter to
the Marxes, warning them that there would be serious legal
consequences if they went forward with their plan.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_136" id=
"footnote_136_call">[136]</a></p>
<p>This led the Marx Brothers to respond in kind. They warned
Warner Brothers that the Marx Brothers "were brothers long before
you were."<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_137" id=
"footnote_137_call">[137]</a> The Marx Brothers therefore owned the
word brothers, and if Warner Brothers insisted on trying to control
Casablanca, then the Marx Brothers would insist on control over
brothers.</p>
<p>An absurd and hollow threat, of course, because Warner Brothers,
like the Marx Brothers, knew that no court would ever enforce such
a silly claim. This extremism was irrelevant to the real freedoms
anyone (including Warner Brothers) enjoyed.</p>
<p>On the Internet, however, there is no check on silly rules,
because on the Internet, increasingly, rules are enforced not by a
human but by a machine: Increasingly, the rules of copyright law,
as interpreted by the copyright owner, get built into the
technology that delivers copyrighted content. It is code, rather
than law, that rules. And the problem with code regulations is
that, unlike law, code has no shame. Code would not get the humor
of the Marx Brothers. The consequence of that is not at all
funny.</p>
<p>Consider the life of my Adobe eBook Reader.</p>
<p>An e-book is a book delivered in electronic form. An Adobe eBook
is not a book that Adobe has published; Adobe simply produces the
software that publishers use to deliver e-books. It provides the
technology, and the publisher delivers the content by using the
technology.</p>
<p>On the next page is a picture of an old version of my Adobe
eBook Reader.</p>
<p>As you can see, I have a small collection of e-books within this
e-book library. Some of these books reproduce content that is in
the public domain: Middlemarch, for example, is in the public
domain. Some of them reproduce content that is not in the public
domain: My own book The Future of Ideas is not yet within the
public domain. Consider Middlemarch first. If you click on my
e-book copy of Middlemarch, you'll see a fancy cover, and then a
button at the bottom called Permissions.</p>
<p>(Figure 5.12 – Acrobat eBook Reader)</p>
<p>If you click on the Permissions button, you'll see a list of the
permissions that the publisher purports to grant with this
book.</p>
<p>(Figure 5.13)</p>
<p>According to my eBook Reader, I have the permission to copy to
the clipboard of the computer ten text selections every ten days.
(So far, I've copied no text to the clipboard.) I also have the
permission to print ten pages from the book every ten days. Lastly,
I have the permission to use the Read Aloud button to hear
Middlemarch read aloud through the computer.</p>
<p>Here's the e-book for another work in the public domain
(including the translation): Aristotle's Politics.</p>
<p>(Figure 5.14)</p>
<p>According to its permissions, no printing or copying is
permitted at all. But fortunately, you can use the Read Aloud
button to hear the book.</p>
<p>(Figure 5.15)</p>
<p>Finally (and most embarrassingly), here are the permissions for
the original e-book version of my last book, The Future of
Ideas:</p>
<p>(Figure 5.16)</p>
<p>No copying, no printing, and don't you dare try to listen to
this book!</p>
<p>Now, the Adobe eBook Reader calls these controls "permissions"—
as if the publisher has the power to control how you use these
works. For works under copyright, the copyright owner certainly
does have the power—up to the limits of the copyright law. But for
work not under copyright, there is no such copyright
power.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_138" id=
"footnote_138_call">[138]</a> When my e-book of Middlemarch says I
have the permission to copy only ten text selections into the
memory every ten days, what that really means is that the eBook
Reader has enabled the publisher to control how I use the book on
my computer, far beyond the control that the law would enable.</p>
<p>The control comes instead from the code—from the technology
within which the e-book "lives." Though the e-book says that these
are permissions, they are not the sort of "permissions" that most
of us deal with. When a teenager gets "permission" to stay out till
midnight, she knows (unless she's Cinderella) that she can stay out
till 2 A.M., but will suffer a punishment if she's caught. But when
the Adobe eBook Reader says I have the permission to make ten
copies of the text into the computer's memory, that means that
after I've made ten copies, the computer will not make any more.
The same with the printing restrictions: After ten pages, the eBook
Reader will not print any more pages. It's the same with the silly
restriction that says that you can't use the Read Aloud button to
read my book aloud—it's not that the company will sue you if you
do; instead, if you push the Read Aloud button with my book, the
machine simply won't read aloud.</p>
<p>These are controls, not permissions. Imagine a world where the
Marx Brothers sold word processing software that, when you tried to
type "Warner Brothers," erased "Brothers" from the sentence.</p>
<p>This is the future of copyright law: not so much copyright law
as copyright code. The controls over access to content will not be
controls that are ratified by courts; the controls over access to
content will be controls that are coded by programmers. And whereas
the controls that are built into the law are always to be checked
by a judge, the controls that are built into the technology have no
similar built-in check.</p>
<p>How significant is this? Isn't it always possible to get around
the controls built into the technology? Software used to be sold
with technologies that limited the ability of users to copy the
software, but those were trivial protections to defeat. Why won't
it be trivial to defeat these protections as well?</p>
<p>We've only scratched the surface of this story. Return to the
Adobe eBook Reader.</p>
<p>Early in the life of the Adobe eBook Reader, Adobe suffered a
public relations nightmare. Among the books that you could download
for free on the Adobe site was a copy of Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland. This wonderful book is in the public domain. Yet when
you clicked on Permissions for that book, you got the following
report:</p>
<p>(Figure 5.17)</p>
<p>Here was a public domain children's book that you were not
allowed to copy, not allowed to lend, not allowed to give, and, as
the "permissions" indicated, not allowed to "read aloud"!</p>
<p>The public relations nightmare attached to that final
permission. For the text did not say that you were not permitted to
use the Read Aloud button; it said you did not have the permission
to read the book aloud. That led some people to think that Adobe
was restricting the right of parents, for example, to read the book
to their children, which seemed, to say the least, absurd.</p>
<p>Adobe responded quickly that it was absurd to think that it was
trying to restrict the right to read a book aloud. Obviously it was
only restricting the ability to use the Read Aloud button to have
the book read aloud. But the question Adobe never did answer is
this: Would Adobe thus agree that a consumer was free to use
software to hack around the restrictions built into the eBook
Reader? If some company (call it Elcomsoft) developed a program to
disable the technological protection built into an Adobe eBook so
that a blind person, say, could use a computer to read the book
aloud, would Adobe agree that such a use of an eBook Reader was
fair? Adobe didn't answer because the answer, however absurd it
might seem, is no.</p>
<p>The point is not to blame Adobe. Indeed, Adobe is among the most
innovative companies developing strategies to balance open access
to content with incentives for companies to innovate. But Adobe's
technology enables control, and Adobe has an incentive to defend
this control. That incentive is understandable, yet what it creates
is often crazy.</p>
<p>To see the point in a particularly absurd context, consider a
favorite story of mine that makes the same point.</p>
<p>Consider the robotic dog made by Sony named "Aibo." The Aibo
learns tricks, cuddles, and follows you around. It eats only
electricity and that doesn't leave that much of a mess (at least in
your house).</p>
<p>The Aibo is expensive and popular. Fans from around the world
have set up clubs to trade stories. One fan in particular set up a
Web site to enable information about the Aibo dog to be shared.
This fan set up aibopet.com (and aibohack.com, but that resolves to
the same site), and on that site he provided information about how
to teach an Aibo to do tricks in addition to the ones Sony had
taught it.</p>
<p>"Teach" here has a special meaning. Aibos are just cute
computers. You teach a computer how to do something by programming
it differently. So to say that aibopet.com was giving information
about how to teach the dog to do new tricks is just to say that
aibopet.com was giving information to users of the Aibo pet about
how to hack their computer "dog" to make it do new tricks (thus,
aibohack.com).</p>
<p>If you're not a programmer or don't know many programmers, the
word hack has a particularly unfriendly connotation. Nonprogrammers
hack bushes or weeds. Nonprogrammers in horror movies do even
worse. But to programmers, or coders, as I call them, hack is a
much more positive term. Hack just means code that enables the
program to do something it wasn't originally intended or enabled to
do. If you buy a new printer for an old computer, you might find
the old computer doesn't run, or "drive," the printer. If you
discovered that, you'd later be happy to discover a hack on the Net
by someone who has written a driver to enable the computer to drive
the printer you just bought.</p>
<p>Some hacks are easy. Some are unbelievably hard. Hackers as a
community like to challenge themselves and others with increasingly
difficult tasks. There's a certain respect that goes with the
talent to hack well. There's a well-deserved respect that goes with
the talent to hack ethically.</p>
<p>The Aibo fan was displaying a bit of both when he hacked the
program and offered to the world a bit of code that would enable
the Aibo to dance jazz. The dog wasn't programmed to dance jazz. It
was a clever bit of tinkering that turned the dog into a more
talented creature than Sony had built.</p>
<p>I've told this story in many contexts, both inside and outside
the United States. Once I was asked by a puzzled member of the
audience, is it permissible for a dog to dance jazz in the United
States? We forget that stories about the backcountry still flow
across much of the world. So let's just be clear before we
continue: It's not a crime anywhere (anymore) to dance jazz. Nor is
it a crime to teach your dog to dance jazz. Nor should it be a
crime (though we don't have a lot to go on here) to teach your
robot dog to dance jazz. Dancing jazz is a completely legal
activity. One imagines that the owner of aibopet.com thought, What
possible problem could there be with teaching a robot dog to
dance?</p>
<p>Let's put the dog to sleep for a minute, and turn to a pony
show— not literally a pony show, but rather a paper that a
Princeton academic named Ed Felten prepared for a conference. This
Princeton academic is well known and respected. He was hired by the
government in the Microsoft case to test Microsoft's claims about
what could and could not be done with its own code. In that trial,
he demonstrated both his brilliance and his coolness. Under heavy
badgering by Microsoft lawyers, Ed Felten stood his ground. He was
not about to be bullied into being silent about something he knew
very well.</p>
<p>But Felten's bravery was really tested in April 2001.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_139" id=
"footnote_139_call">[139]</a> He and a group of colleagues were
working on a paper to be submitted at conference. The paper was
intended to describe the weakness in an encryption system being
developed by the Secure Digital Music Initiative as a technique to
control the distribution of music.</p>
<p>The SDMI coalition had as its goal a technology to enable
content owners to exercise much better control over their content
than the Internet, as it originally stood, granted them. Using
encryption, SDMI hoped to develop a standard that would allow the
content owner to say "this music cannot be copied," and have a
computer respect that command. The technology was to be part of a
"trusted system" of control that would get content owners to trust
the system of the Internet much more.</p>
<p>When SDMI thought it was close to a standard, it set up a
competition. In exchange for providing contestants with the code to
an SDMI-encrypted bit of content, contestants were to try to crack
it and, if they did, report the problems to the consortium.</p>
<p>Felten and his team figured out the encryption system quickly.
He and the team saw the weakness of this system as a type: Many
encryption systems would suffer the same weakness, and Felten and
his team thought it worthwhile to point this out to those who study
encryption.</p>
<p>Let's review just what Felten was doing. Again, this is the
United States. We have a principle of free speech. We have this
principle not just because it is the law, but also because it is a
really great idea. A strongly protected tradition of free speech is
likely to encourage a wide range of criticism. That criticism is
likely, in turn, to improve the systems or people or ideas
criticized.</p>
<p>What Felten and his colleagues were doing was publishing a paper
describing the weakness in a technology. They were not spreading
free music, or building and deploying this technology. The paper
was an academic essay, unintelligible to most people. But it
clearly showed the weakness in the SDMI system, and why SDMI would
not, as presently constituted, succeed.</p>
<p>What links these two, aibopet.com and Felten, is the letters
they then received. Aibopet.com received a letter from Sony about
the aibopet.com hack. Though a jazz-dancing dog is perfectly legal,
Sony wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your site contains information providing the means to circumvent
AIBO-ware's copy protection protocol constituting a violation of
the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And though an academic paper describing the weakness in a system
of encryption should also be perfectly legal, Felten received a
letter from an RIAA lawyer that read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any disclosure of information gained from participating in the
Public Challenge would be outside the scope of activities permitted
by the Agreement and could subject you and your research team to
actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA").</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In both cases, this weirdly Orwellian law was invoked to control
the spread of information. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act
made spreading such information an offense.</p>
<p>The DMCA was enacted as a response to copyright owners' first
fear about cyberspace. The fear was that copyright control was
effectively dead; the response was to find technologies that might
compensate. These new technologies would be copyright protection
technologies— technologies to control the replication and
distribution of copyrighted material. They were designed as code to
modify the original code of the Internet, to reestablish some
protection for copyright owners.</p>
<p>The DMCA was a bit of law intended to back up the protection of
this code designed to protect copyrighted material. It was, we
could say, legal code intended to buttress software code which
itself was intended to support the legal code of copyright.</p>
<p>But the DMCA was not designed merely to protect copyrighted
works to the extent copyright law protected them. Its protection,
that is, did not end at the line that copyright law drew. The DMCA
regulated devices that were designed to circumvent copyright
protection measures. It was designed to ban those devices, whether
or not the use of the copyrighted material made possible by that
circumvention would have been a copyright violation.</p>
<p>Aibopet.com and Felten make the point. The Aibo hack
circumvented a copyright protection system for the purpose of
enabling the dog to dance jazz. That enablement no doubt involved
the use of copyrighted material. But as aibopet.com's site was
noncommercial, and the use did not enable subsequent copyright
infringements, there's no doubt that aibopet.com's hack was fair
use of Sony's copyrighted material. Yet fair use is not a defense
to the DMCA. The question is not whether the use of the copyrighted
material was a copyright violation. The question is whether a
copyright protection system was circumvented.</p>
<p>The threat against Felten was more attenuated, but it followed
the same line of reasoning. By publishing a paper describing how a
copyright protection system could be circumvented, the RIAA lawyer
suggested, Felten himself was distributing a circumvention
technology. Thus, even though he was not himself infringing
anyone's copyright, his academic paper was enabling others to
infringe others' copyright.</p>
<p>The bizarreness of these arguments is captured in a cartoon
drawn in 1981 by Paul Conrad. At that time, a court in California
had held that the VCR could be banned because it was a
copyright-infringing technology: It enabled consumers to copy films
without the permission of the copyright owner. No doubt there were
uses of the technology that were legal: Fred Rogers, aka "Mr.
Rogers," for example, had testified in that case that he wanted
people to feel free to tape Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program
the "Neighborhood" at hours when some children cannot use it. I
think that it's a real service to families to be able to record
such programs and show them at appropriate times. I have always
felt that with the advent of all of this new technology that allows
people to tape the "Neighborhood" off-the-air, and I'm speaking for
the "Neighborhood" because that's what I produce, that they then
become much more active in the programming of their family's
television life. Very frankly, I am opposed to people being
programmed by others. My whole approach in broadcasting has always
been "You are an important person just the way you are. You can
make healthy decisions." Maybe I'm going on too long, but I just
feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in the
control of his or her life, in a healthy way, is
important.<a class="footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_140" id=
"footnote_140_call">[140]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though there were uses that were legal, because there were
some uses that were illegal, the court held the companies producing
the VCR responsible.</p>
<p>This led Conrad to draw the cartoon below, which we can adopt to
the DMCA.</p>
<p>No argument I have can top this picture, but let me try to get
close.</p>
<p>The anticircumvention provisions of the DMCA target copyright
circumvention technologies. Circumvention technologies can be used
for different ends. They can be used, for example, to enable
massive pirating of copyrighted material—a bad end. Or they can be
used to enable the use of particular copyrighted materials in ways
that would be considered fair use—a good end.</p>
<p>A handgun can be used to shoot a police officer or a child. Most
would agree such a use is bad. Or a handgun can be used for target
practice or to protect against an intruder. At least some would say
that such a use would be good. It, too, is a technology that has
both good and bad uses.</p>
<p>(Figure 5.18)</p>
<p>The obvious point of Conrad's cartoon is the weirdness of a
world where guns are legal, despite the harm they can do, while
VCRs (and circumvention technologies) are illegal. Flash: No one
ever died from copyright circumvention. Yet the law bans
circumvention technologies absolutely, despite the potential that
they might do some good, but permits guns, despite the obvious and
tragic harm they do.</p>
<p>The Aibo and RIAA examples demonstrate how copyright owners are
changing the balance that copyright law grants. Using code,
copyright owners restrict fair use; using the DMCA, they punish
those who would attempt to evade the restrictions on fair use that
they impose through code. Technology becomes a means by which fair
use can be erased; the law of the DMCA backs up that erasing.</p>
<p>This is how code becomes law. The controls built into the
technology of copy and access protection become rules the violation
of which is also a violation of the law. In this way, the code
extends the law—increasing its regulation, even if the subject it
regulates (activities that would otherwise plainly constitute fair
use) is beyond the reach of the law. Code becomes law; code extends
the law; code thus extends the control that copyright owners
effect—at least for those copyright holders with the lawyers who
can write the nasty letters that Felten and aibopet.com
received.</p>
<p>There is one final aspect of the interaction between
architecture and law that contributes to the force of copyright's
regulation. This is the ease with which infringements of the law
can be detected. For contrary to the rhetoric common at the birth
of cyberspace that on the Internet, no one knows you're a dog,
increasingly, given changing technologies deployed on the Internet,
it is easy to find the dog who committed a legal wrong. The
technologies of the Internet are open to snoops as well as sharers,
and the snoops are increasingly good at tracking down the identity
of those who violate the rules.</p>
<p>For example, imagine you were part of a Star Trek fan club. You
gathered every month to share trivia, and maybe to enact a kind of
fan fiction about the show. One person would play Spock, another,
Captain Kirk. The characters would begin with a plot from a real
story, then simply continue it.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_141" id="footnote_141_call">[141]</a></p>
<p>Before the Internet, this was, in effect, a totally unregulated
activity. No matter what happened inside your club room, you would
never be interfered with by the copyright police. You were free in
that space to do as you wished with this part of our culture. You
were allowed to build on it as you wished without fear of legal
control.</p>
<p>But if you moved your club onto the Internet, and made it
generally available for others to join, the story would be very
different. Bots scouring the Net for trademark and copyright
infringement would quickly find your site. Your posting of fan
fiction, depending upon the ownership of the series that you're
depicting, could well inspire a lawyer's threat. And ignoring the
lawyer's threat would be extremely costly indeed. The law of
copyright is extremely efficient. The penalties are severe, and the
process is quick.</p>
<p>This change in the effective force of the law is caused by a
change in the ease with which the law can be enforced. That change
too shifts the law's balance radically. It is as if your car
transmitted the speed at which you traveled at every moment that
you drove; that would be just one step before the state started
issuing tickets based upon the data you transmitted. That is, in
effect, what is happening here.</p>
