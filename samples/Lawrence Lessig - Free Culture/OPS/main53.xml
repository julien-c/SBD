<div class="text">
<p>As I observed at the beginning of this book, property law
originally granted property owners the right to control their
property from the ground to the heavens. The airplane came along.
The scope of property rights quickly changed. There was no fuss, no
constitutional challenge. It made no sense anymore to grant that
much control, given the emergence of that new technology.</p>
<p>Our Constitution gives Congress the power to give authors
"exclusive right" to "their writings." Congress has given authors
an exclusive right to "their writings" plus any derivative writings
(made by others) that are sufficiently close to the author's
original work. Thus, if I write a book, and you base a movie on
that book, I have the power to deny you the right to release that
movie, even though that movie is not "my writing."</p>
<p>Congress granted the beginnings of this right in 1870, when it
expanded the exclusive right of copyright to include a right to
control translations and dramatizations of a work.<a class=
"footnote" href="footnotes.xml#footnote_216" id=
"footnote_216_call">[216]</a> The courts have expanded it slowly
through judicial interpretation ever since. This expansion has been
commented upon by one of the law's greatest judges, Judge Benjamin
Kaplan.</p>
<p>So inured have we become to the extension of the monopoly to a
large range of so-called derivative works, that we no longer sense
the oddity of accepting such an enlargement of copyright while yet
intoning the abracadabra of idea and expression.<a class="footnote"
href="footnotes.xml#footnote_217" id=
"footnote_217_call">[217]</a></p>
<p>I think it's time to recognize that there are airplanes in this
field and the expansiveness of these rights of derivative use no
longer make sense. More precisely, they don't make sense for the
period of time that a copyright runs. And they don't make sense as
an amorphous grant. Consider each limitation in turn.</p>
<p>Term: If Congress wants to grant a derivative right, then that
right should be for a much shorter term. It makes sense to protect
John Grisham's right to sell the movie rights to his latest novel
(or at least I'm willing to assume it does); but it does not make
sense for that right to run for the same term as the underlying
copyright. The derivative right could be important in inducing
creativity; it is not important long after the creative work is
done.</p>
<p>Scope: Likewise should the scope of derivative rights be
narrowed. Again, there are some cases in which derivative rights
are important. Those should be specified. But the law should draw
clear lines around regulated and unregulated uses of copyrighted
material. When all "reuse" of creative material was within the
control of businesses, perhaps it made sense to require lawyers to
negotiate the lines. It no longer makes sense for lawyers to
negotiate the lines. Think about all the creative possibilities
that digital technologies enable; now imagine pouring molasses into
the machines. That's what this general requirement of permission
does to the creative process. Smothers it.</p>
<p>This was the point that Alben made when describing the making of
the Clint Eastwood CD. While it makes sense to require negotiation
for foreseeable derivative rights—turning a book into a movie, or a
poem into a musical score—it doesn't make sense to require
negotiation for the unforeseeable. Here, a statutory right would
make much more sense.</p>
<p>In each of these cases, the law should mark the uses that are
protected, and the presumption should be that other uses are not
protected. This is the reverse of the recommendation of my
colleague Paul Goldstein.<a class="footnote" href=
"footnotes.xml#footnote_218" id="footnote_218_call">[218]</a> His
view is that the law should be written so that expanded protections
follow expanded uses.</p>
<p>Goldstein's analysis would make perfect sense if the cost of the
legal system were small. But as we are currently seeing in the
context of the Internet, the uncertainty about the scope of
protection, and the incentives to protect existing architectures of
revenue, combined with a strong copyright, weaken the process of
innovation.</p>
<p>The law could remedy this problem either by removing protection
beyond the part explicitly drawn or by granting reuse rights upon
certain statutory conditions. Either way, the effect would be to
free a great deal of culture to others to cultivate. And under a
statutory rights regime, that reuse would earn artists more
income.</p>
