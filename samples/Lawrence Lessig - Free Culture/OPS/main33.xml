<p>To fight "piracy," to protect "property," the content industry
has launched a war. Lobbying and lots of campaign contributions
have now brought the government into this war. As with any war,
this one will have both direct and collateral damage. As with any
war of prohibition, these damages will be suffered most by our own
people.</p>
<p>My aim so far has been to describe the consequences of this war,
in particular, the consequences for "free culture." But my aim now
is to extend this description of consequences into an argument. Is
this war justified?</p>
<p>In my view, it is not. There is no good reason why this time,
for the first time, the law should defend the old against the new,
just when the power of the property called "intellectual property"
is at its greatest in our history.</p>
<p>Yet "common sense" does not see it this way. Common sense is
still on the side of the Causbys and the content industry. The
extreme claims of control in the name of property still resonate;
the uncritical rejection of "piracy" still has play.</p>
<p>There will be many consequences of continuing this war. I want
to describe just three. All three might be said to be unintended. I
am quite confident the third is unintended. I'm less sure about the
first two. The first two protect modern RCAs, but there is no
Howard Armstrong in the wings to fight today's monopolists of
culture.</p>
